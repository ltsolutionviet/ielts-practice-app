        <h2>This Marvellous Invention</h2>

    <p><strong>A - Why language is the most important invention of all</strong></p>
    <p>Of all mankinds manifold creations, language must take pride of place. Other inventions -the wheel, agriculture, sliced bread - may have transformed our <span class="explainq7 explain">material</span> existence, but the advent of language is what made us human. <span class="explainq1 explain">Compared to language, all other inventions pale&nbsp;in significance, since <span class="explainq8 explain">everything we have ever achieved depends on language and originates&nbsp;from it</span></span>. <span class="explainq11 explain">Without language, we could never have embarked on our ascent to unparalleled power over all other animals, and even over nature itself</span>.</p>
    <p><strong>B -&nbsp;Apparently incompatible characteristics of language</strong></p>
    <p>But language is foremost not just because it came first. <span class="explainq2 explain">In its own right it is a tool of&nbsp;extraordinary <span class="explainq9 explain">sophistication</span>, yet based on an idea of ingenious simplicity</span>: ‘this marvellous invention of composing out of twenty-five or thirty sounds that infinite variety of&nbsp;expressions which, whilst having in themselves no likeness to what is in our mind, allow&nbsp;us to disclose to others its whole secret, and to make known to those who cannot penetrate&nbsp;it all that we imagine, and all the various stirrings of our soul’ .<span class="explainq12 explain">This was how, in 1660,&nbsp;the renowned French grammarians of the Port-Royal abbey near Versailles distilled the&nbsp;essence of language</span>, and no one since has celebrated more eloquently the magnitude of its&nbsp;achievement. Even so, there is just one flaw in all these hymns of praise, for the homage to&nbsp;languages unique accomplishment conceals a simple yet critical incongruity. Language is&nbsp;mankind s greatest invention - except, of course, that it was never invented. This apparent&nbsp;paradox is at the core of our fascination with language, and it holds many of its secrets.</p>
    <p><strong>C -&nbsp;The way in which a few sounds are organised to convey a huge&nbsp;range of meaning</strong></p>
    <p>Language often seems so skillfully drafted that one can hardly imagine it as anything other than the perfected handiwork of a master craftsman. How else could this instrument&nbsp;make so much out of barely three dozen measly morsels of sound? In themselves, these&nbsp;configurations of mouth p,f,b,v,t,d,k,g,sh,a,e &nbsp;and so on - amount to nothing more than a&nbsp;few haphazard spits and splutters, random noises with no meaning, no ability to express,&nbsp;no power to explain. But run them through the cogs and wheels of the language machine,&nbsp;let it arrange them in some very special orders, and there is nothing that these meaningless&nbsp;streams of air cannot do: <span class="explainq3 explain">from sighing the interminable boredom of existence to unravelling the fundamental order of the universe</span>.</p>
    <p><strong>D -&nbsp;The universal ability to use language</strong></p>
    <p><span class="explainq4 explain">The most extraordinary thing about language, however, is that one <span class="explainq10 explain">doesn’t have to be a&nbsp;genius to set its wheels in motion</span></span>. The language machine allows just about everybody from pre-modern foragers in the subtropical savannah, to post-modern philosophers in the&nbsp;suburban sprawl - to tie these meaningless sounds together into an infinite variety of subtle&nbsp;senses, and all apparently without the slightest exertion. Yet it is precisely this deceptive ease which makes language a victim of its own success, since in everyday life its triumphs are&nbsp;usually taken for granted. The wheels of language run so smoothly that one rarely bothers to&nbsp;stop and think about all the resourcefulness and expertise that must have gone into making it tick. Language conceals art.</p>
    <p><strong>E -&nbsp;Differences between languages highlight their impressiveness</strong></p>
    <p><span class="explainq5 explain">Often, it is only the estrangement of foreign tongues, with their many exotic and outlandish&nbsp;features, that brings home the wonder of languages design</span>. One of the showiest stunts that some languages can pull off is an ability to build up words of breath-breaking length, and&nbsp;thus express in one word what English takes a whole sentence to say. The Turkish word çehirliliçtiremediklerimizdensiniz, to take one example, means nothing less than ‘you are one of those whom we can’t turn into a town-dweller’. (In case you were wondering, this&nbsp;monstrosity really is one word, not merely many different words squashed together - most ol&nbsp;its components cannot even stand up on their own.)</p>
    <p><strong>F -&nbsp;Even silence can be meaningful</strong></p>
    <p><span class="explainq14 explain">And if that sounds like some one-off freak, then consider Sumerian, the language spoken&nbsp;on the banks of the Euphrates some 5,000 years ago by the people who invented writing and thus enabled the documentation of history</span>. A Sumerian word like munintuma'a (‘when&nbsp;he had made it suitable for her’) might seem rather trim compared to the Turkish colossus&nbsp;above. What is so impressive about it, however, is not its lengthiness but rather the reverse&nbsp;- the thrifty compactness of its construction. The word is made up of different slots, each&nbsp;corresponding to a particular portion of meaning. This sleek design allows single sounds&nbsp;to convey useful information, and in fact even the absence of a sound has been enlisted to&nbsp;express something specific. If you were to ask which bit in the Sumerian word corresponds&nbsp;to the pronoun ‘it’ in the English translation ‘when he had made it suitable for her’, then the&nbsp;answer would have to be nothing. Mind you, a very particular kind of nothing: the nothing&nbsp;that stands in the empty slot in the middle. <span class="explainq6 explain">The technology is so fine-tuned then that even a&nbsp;non-sound, when carefully placed in a particular position, has been invested with a specific&nbsp;function</span>. Who could possibly have come up with such a nifty contraption?</p>
    <p><span class="explainq13 explain">A complex idea can be explained more clearly in a sentence than in a single word: NOT GIVEN</span></p>
