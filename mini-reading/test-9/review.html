    <p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Emma Duncan&nbsp;discusses the&nbsp;potential effects on&nbsp;the entertainment&nbsp;industry of the&nbsp;digital revolution</strong></em></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>A</strong> Since moving pictures were invented a century ago, a new way of distributing entertainment to consumers has emerged about once every generation. <span class="explainq3 explain">Each such innovation has changed the industry irreversibly; each has been accompanied by a period of fear mixed with exhilaration</span>. The arrival of digital technology, which translates music, pictures and text into the zeros and ones of computer language, marks one of those periods.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>B</strong> This may sound familiar, because the digital revolution, and the explosion of choice that would go with it, has been heralded for some time. <span class="explainq12 explain">In 1992, John Malone, chief executive of TCI, an American cable giant, welcomed the '500-channel universe'</span>. Digital television was about to deliver everything except pizzas to people's living rooms. <span class="explainq5 explain">When the entertainment companies tried out the technology, it worked fine - but not at a price that people were prepared to pay</span>.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>C</strong> Those 500 channels eventually arrived but via the Internet and the PC rather than through television. The digital revolution was starting to affect the entertainment business in unexpected ways. <span class="explainq2 explain">Eventually it will change every aspect of it, from the way cartoons are made to the way films are screened to the way people buy music. That much is clear</span>. <span class="explainq6 explain">What nobody is sure of is how it will affect the economics of the business.</span></span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>D</strong> New technologies always contain within them both threats and opportunities. <span class="explainq1 explain">They have the potential both to make the companies in the business a great deal richer, and to sweep them away</span>. <span class="explainq9 explain">Old companies always fear new technology. Hollywood was hostile to television, television terrified by the VCR. Go back far enough, points out Hal Varian</span>, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, and you find publishers complaining that 'circulating libraries' would cannibalise their sales. Yet whenever a new technology has come in, it has made more money for existing entertainment companies. The proliferation of the means of distribution results, gratifyingly, in the proliferation of dollars, pounds, pesetas and the rest to pay for it.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>E</strong> All the same, there is something in the old companies' fears. New technologies may not threaten their lives, but they usually change their role. Once television became widespread, film and radio stopped being the staple form of entertainment. Cable television has undermined the power of the broadcasters. And as power has shifted the movie studios, the radio companies and the television broadcasters have been swallowed up. These days, the grand old names of entertainment have more resonance than power. Paramount is part of Viacom, a cable company; Universal, part of Seagram, a drinks-and-entertainment company; <span class="explainq11 explain"><strong>MGM</strong>, once the roaring lion of Hollywood, has been reduced to a whisper because it is not part of one of the giants</span>. And RCA, once the most important broadcasting company in the world, is now a recording label belonging to Bertelsmann, a large German entertainment company.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span class="explainq14 explain"><strong>F</strong></span> <span class="explainq7 explain">Part of the reason why incumbents got pushed aside was that they did not see what was coming. But they also faced a tighter regulatory environment than the present one.</span> In America, laws preventing television broadcasters from owning programme companies were repealed earlier this decade, allowing the creation of vertically integrated businesses. Greater freedom, combined with a sense of history, prompted <span class="explainq4 explain">the smarter companies in the entertainment business</span> to re-invent themselves. <span class="explainq17 explain">They saw what happened to those of their predecessors who were stuck with one form of distribution</span>.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, these days, the powers in the entertainment business are no longer movie studios, or television broadcasters, or publishers; all those businesses have become part of bigger businesses still, companies that can both create content and distribute it in a range of different ways.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span class="explainq13 explain"><strong>G</strong></span> Out of all this, seven huge entertainment companies have emerged - Time Warner, Walt Disney, Bertelsmann, Viacom, News Corp, Seagram and Sony. They cover pretty well every bit of the entertainment business except pornography. Three are American, one is Australian, one Canadian, one German and one Japanese. 'What you are seeing', says <strong>Christopher Dixon</strong>, managing director of media research at PaineWebber, a stockbroker, 'is the creation of a global oligopoly.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span class="explainq10 explain">It happened to the oil and automotive businesses earlier this century; now it is happening to the entertainment business</span>.' <span class="explainq8 explain">It remains to be seen whether the latest technology will weaken those great companies, or make them stronger than ever</span>.</span></p>
