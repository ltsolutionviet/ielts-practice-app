    <h2>IELTS Reading Part 1 — The History of Bicycle</h2>
    <p><strong>1. hundred/100.</strong> ‘Nearly’ shouldn’t be used here, as there is already a definite article that means certainty.<br> <strong>2. pedals.</strong> Make sure you use the word in the plural. When used in the singular, the word would give you no points even though you got the general idea right.<br> <strong>3. toys.</strong> Last sentence of the last paragraph. Again, if you don’t pluralize the word, it won’t be scored as correct.<br> <strong>4. overseas.</strong>&nbsp;‘Overseas’ is one word, not two.<br> <strong>5. hollow steel tubes.</strong> You can use up to three words for your answer.<br> <strong>6. axle.</strong>&nbsp;Word ‘rear’ helps find the answer in the seventh paragraph.</p>
    <p><strong>7. False.</strong> Inventors from Scotland and France are clearly mentioned. Moreover, the very first sentence openly states that it was a collective effort of many people from different countries.<br> <strong>8. True.</strong>&nbsp;Third paragraph, third sentence states that it was hard to move the bicycle forward due to its heavy weight.<br> <strong>9. True.</strong> It is said that it was easier to maintain balance, and the whole experience was much less likely to end in an injury.<br> <strong>10. True.</strong>&nbsp;First sentence of Paragraph Six confirms this. The sentences that follow explain in detail how the new modification helped to make pedalling more efficient.</p>
    <p><strong>11. size.</strong> The word ‘diameter’ would be the wrong answer, as you have to use words from the text, not your own. The word ‘size’ is mentioned in last but one paragraph.<br> <strong>12. foot levers.</strong>&nbsp;Paragraph Seven, fourth sentence. ‘Levers’ has to be plural.<br> <strong>13. chain.</strong>&nbsp;Last but one paragraph mentions this alteration.</p>
