    <p><span class="explainq1 explain"><strong>A </strong></span><strong>An undisputed answer to a question about the moai</strong></p>
    <p>Easter Island, or Rapu Nui as it is known locally, is home to several hundred&nbsp;ancient human statues - the moai. After this remote Pacific island was settled by the Polynesians, it remained isolated for centuries. All the energy and resources&nbsp;that went into the moai - some of which are ten metres tall and weigh over 7,000&nbsp;kilos - came from the island itself. Yet when Dutch explorers landed in 1722, they&nbsp;met a Stone Age culture. The moai were carved with stone tools, then transported&nbsp;for many kilometres, without the use of animals or wheels, to massive stone&nbsp;platforms. The identity of the moai builders was in doubt until well into the twentieth&nbsp;century. Thor Heyerdahl, the Norwegian ethnographer and adventurer, thought the&nbsp;statues had been created by pre-Inca peoples from Peru. Bestselling Swiss author&nbsp;Erich von Daniken believed they were built by stranded extraterrestrials. Modern&nbsp;science - linguistic, archaeological and genetic evidence - has definitively proved&nbsp;the moai builders were Polynesians, but not how they moved their creations.&nbsp;Local folklore maintains that the statues walked, while researchers have tended to assume the ancestors dragged the statues somehow, using ropes and logs.</p>
    <p><strong><span class="explainq2 explain">B</span> Diminishing food resources</strong></p>
    <p>When the Europeans arrived, Rapa Nui was grassland, with only a few scrawny&nbsp;trees. In the 1970s and 1980s, though, researchers found pollen preserved in lake sediments, which proved the island had been covered in lush palm forests for&nbsp;thousands of years. Only after the Polynesians arrived did those forests disappear.&nbsp;US scientist Jared Diamond believes that the Rapanui people - descendants of&nbsp;Polynesian settlers - wrecked their own environment. They had unfortunately&nbsp;settled on an extremely fragile island - dry, cool, and too remote to be properly&nbsp;fertilised by windblown volcanic ash. When the islanders cleared the forests for&nbsp;firewood and <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span class="explainq8 explain">farming</span></span></strong>, the forests didn’t grow back. As trees became scarce and&nbsp;they could no longer construct wooden <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span class="explainq9 explain">canoes</span></span></strong>&nbsp;for fishing, they ate <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span class="explainq10 explain">birds</span></span></strong>. Soil&nbsp;erosion decreased their crop yields. Before Europeans arrived, the Rapanui had&nbsp;descended into civil war and cannibalism, he maintains. The collapse of their&nbsp;isolated civilisation, Diamond writes, is a ’worst-case scenario for what may lie&nbsp;ahead of us in our own future’.</p>
    <p><strong><span class="explainq3 explain">C</span> How the statues made a situation worse</strong></p>
    <p>The moai, he thinks, accelerated the self-destruction. Diamond interprets them as power displays by <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong><span class="explainq13 explain">rival chieftains</span></strong></span>&nbsp;who, trapped on a remote little island, lacked other ways of asserting their dominance. They competed by building ever bigger&nbsp;figures. Diamond thinks they laid the moai on wooden sledges, hauled over log&nbsp;rails, but that required both a lot of <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span class="explainq11 explain">wood</span></strong></span>&nbsp;<span style="color: #3366ff;">and <strong><span class="explainq12 explain">a lot of people</span></strong></span>. To feed the people,&nbsp;even more land had to be cleared. When the wood was gone and civil war began,&nbsp;the islanders began toppling the moai. By the nineteenth century none were&nbsp;standing.</p>
    <p><span class="explainq4 explain"><strong>D</strong></span> <strong>Evidence of innovative environment management practices</strong></p>
    <p>Archaeologists Terry Hunt of the University of Hawaii and Carl Lipo of California State University agree that Easter Island lost its lush forests and that it was an&nbsp;‘ecological catastrophe' - but they believe the islanders themselves weren’t to&nbsp;blame. And the moai certainly weren’t. Archaeological excavations indicate that the&nbsp;Rapanui went to heroic efforts to protect the resources of their wind-lashed, infertile&nbsp;fields. They built thousands of circular stone windbreaks and gardened inside them,&nbsp;and used broken volcanic rocks to keep the soil moist. In short, Hunt and Lipo&nbsp;argue, the prehistoric Rapanui were pioneers of sustainable farming.</p>
    <p><strong><span class="explainq5 explain">E</span><span style="color: #339966;">&nbsp;</span>A theory which supports a local belief</strong></p>
    <p>Hunt and Lipo contend that moai-building was an <span class="explainq13 explain">activity that helped keep the peace</span> between islanders.&nbsp;<span style="color: #3366ff;"><span class="explainq12 explain">They also believe that moving the moai required <strong>few&nbsp;people and no wood,</strong> because they were walked upright</span></span>. On that issue, Hunt and&nbsp;Lipo say, archaeological evidence backs up Rapanui folklore. Recent experiments&nbsp;indicate that as few as 18 people could, with three strong ropes and a bit of&nbsp;practice, easily manoeuvre a 1,000 kg moai replica a few hundred metres. The figures’ fat bellies tilted them forward, and a D-shaped base allowed handlers to roll and rock them side to side.</p>
    <p><strong><span class="explainq6 explain">F</span><span style="color: #339966;">&nbsp;</span>Destruction outside the inhabitants’ control</strong></p>
    <p>Moreover, Hunt and Lipo are convinced that the settlers were not wholly&nbsp;responsible for the loss of the island’s trees. Archaeological finds of nuts from the extinct Easter Island palm show tiny grooves, made by the teeth of Polynesian&nbsp;rats. The rats arrived along with the settlers, and in just a few years, Hunt and Lipo&nbsp;calculate, they would have overrun the island. They would have prevented the&nbsp;reseeding of the slow-growing palm trees and thereby doomed Rapa Nui’s forest,&nbsp;even without the settlers’ campaign of deforestation. No doubt the rats ate birds’&nbsp;eggs too. Hunt and Lipo also see no evidence that Rapanui civilisation collapsed&nbsp;when the palm forest did. They think its population grew rapidly and then remained&nbsp;more or less stable until the arrival of the Europeans, who introduced deadly&nbsp;diseases to which islanders had no immunity. Then in the nineteenth century slave&nbsp;traders decimated the population, which shrivelled to 111 people by 1877.</p>
    <p><strong><span class="explainq7 explain">G</span> Two opposing views about the Rapanui people</strong></p>
    <p>Hunt and Lipo’s vision, therefore, is one of an island populated by peaceful and ingenious moai builders and careful stewards of the land, rather than by reckless&nbsp;destroyers ruining their own environment and society. ‘Rather than a case of abject&nbsp;failure<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>,</strong></span> Rapu Nui is an unlikely story of success’, they claim. Whichever is the case,&nbsp;there are surely some valuable lessons which the world at large can learn from the&nbsp;story of Rapa Nui.</p>
