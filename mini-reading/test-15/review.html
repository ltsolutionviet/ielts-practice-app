    <p><em>The question of whether we are alone in the Universe has haunted humanity for centuries,&nbsp;but we may now stand poised on the brink of&nbsp;the answer to that question, as we search for&nbsp;radio signals from other intelligent civilisations.&nbsp;This search, often known by the acronym SETI (search for extra-terrestrial intelligence], is a&nbsp;difficult one. Although groups around the world&nbsp;have been searching intermittently for three&nbsp;decades, it is only now that we have reached&nbsp;the level of technology where we can make a&nbsp;determined attempt to search all nearby stars&nbsp;for any sign of life.</em>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>A -&nbsp;Reasons for the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence</strong></p>
    <p>The primary reason for the search is basic curiosity - the same curiosity about the natural world that drives all pure science. We want to know whether we are alone in the Universe.&nbsp;We want to know whether life evolves naturally if given the right conditions, or whether there&nbsp;is something very special about the Earth to have fostered the variety of life forms that&nbsp;we see around us on the planet. The simple detection of a radio signal will be sufficient to&nbsp;answer this most basic of all questions. In this sense, SETI is another cog in the machinery&nbsp;of pure science which is continually pushing out the horizon of our knowledge. However,&nbsp;there are other reasons for being interested in whether life exists elsewhere. For example,&nbsp;we have had civilisation on Earth for perhaps only a few thousand years, and the threats of&nbsp;nuclear war and pollution over the last few decades have told us that our survival may be&nbsp;tenuous. Will we last another two thousand years or will we wipe ourselves out? Since the&nbsp;lifetime of a planet like ours is <span class="explainq5 explain">several billion years</span>, we can expect that, if other civilisations&nbsp;do survive in our galaxy, their ages will range from zero to several billion years. Thus any&nbsp;other civilisation that we hear from is likely to be far older, on average, than ourselves. The&nbsp;mere existence of such a civilisation will tell us that long-term survival is possible, and gives&nbsp;us some cause for optimism. <span class="explainq8 explain">It is even possible that the older civilisation may pass on the&nbsp;benefits of their experience in dealing with threats to survival such as nuclear war and global&nbsp;pollution, and other threats that we haven’t yet discovered.</span></p>
    <p><strong>B -&nbsp;Assumptions underlying the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence</strong></p>
    <p><span class="explainq1 explain">In discussing whether we are alone, most SETI scientists adopt two ground rules</span>. First, UFQs (Unidentified Flying Objects) are generally ignored since most scientists don’t&nbsp;consider the evidence for them to be strong enough to bear serious consideration&nbsp;(although it is also important to keep an open mind in case any really convincing evidence&nbsp;emerges in the future). Second, we make a very conservative assumption that we are&nbsp;looking for a life form that is pretty well like us, since<span class="explainq9 explain"> if it differs radically from us we may&nbsp;well not recognise it as a life form, quite apart from whether we are able to communicate with it.</span> In other words, the life form we are looking for may well have two green heads and seven fingers, but it will nevertheless resemble us in that it should communicate with&nbsp;its fellows, be interested in the Universe, live on a planet orbiting a star like our Sun, and&nbsp;perhaps most restrictively, have a chemistry, like us, based on carbon and water.</p>
    <p><strong>C -&nbsp;Likelihood of life on other planets</strong></p>
    <p>Even when we make these assumptions, our understanding of other life forms is still severely limited. We do not even know, for example, how many stars have planets, and we&nbsp;certainly do not know how likely it is that life will arise naturally, given the right conditions.&nbsp;However, when we look at the 100 billion stars in our galaxy (the Milky Way), and 100&nbsp;billion galaxies in the observable Universe, it seems inconceivable that at least one of&nbsp;these planets does not have a life form on it; <span class="explainq2 explain">in fact, the best educated guess we can&nbsp;make, using the little that we do know about the conditions for carbon-based life, leads us&nbsp;to estimate that perhaps one in 100,000 stars might have a life-bearing planet orbiting&nbsp;it.</span> That means that our nearest neighbours are perhaps 100 light years away, which is&nbsp;almost next door in astronomical terms.</p>
    <p><strong>D -&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Seeking the transmission of radio signals from planets</strong></p>
    <p>An alien civilisation could choose many different ways of sending information across the galaxy, but many of these either require too much energy, or else are severely attenuated&nbsp;while traversing the vast distances across the galaxy. It turns out that, for a given amount&nbsp;of transmitted power, radio waves in the frequency range 1000 to 3000 MHz travel the&nbsp;greatest distance, and <span class="explainq3 explain">so all searches to date have concentrated on looking for <span class="explainq6 explain">radio waves</span>&nbsp;in this frequency range. So far there have been a number of searches by various groups&nbsp;around the world</span>, including Australian searches using the radio telescope at Parkes, New&nbsp;South Wales. <span class="explainq11 explain">Until now there have not been any detections from the few hundred stars&nbsp;which have been searched.</span> The scale of the searches has been increased dramatically since&nbsp;1992, when the US Congress voted NASA $10 million per year for ten years to conduct a&nbsp;thorough search for extra-terrestrial life. Much of the money in this project is being spent&nbsp;on developing the special hardware needed to search many frequencies at once. The project&nbsp;has two parts. One part is a targeted search using the world’s largest radio telescopes, the&nbsp;American-operated telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico and the French telescope in Nancy&nbsp;in France. This part of the project is searching the nearest <span class="explainq7 explain">1000</span> likely stars with high&nbsp;sensitivity for signals in the frequency range 1000 to 3000 MHz. The other part of the&nbsp;project is an undirected search which is monitoring all of space with a lower sensitivity, using&nbsp;the smaller antennas of NASA’s Deep Space Network.</p>
    <p><strong>E -&nbsp;Appropriate responses to signals from other civilisations</strong></p>
    <p><span class="explainq4 explain">There is considerable debate over how we should react if we detect a signal from an alien civilisation. Everybody agrees that we should not reply immediately.</span> Quite apart from the&nbsp;impracticality of sending a reply over such large distances at short notice, it raises a host&nbsp;of ethical questions that would have to be addressed by the global community before any&nbsp;reply could be sent. Would the human race face the culture shock if faced with a superior&nbsp;and much older civilisation? Luckily, there is no urgency about this. The stars being&nbsp;searched are hundreds of light years away, so it takes hundreds of years for their signal to&nbsp;reach us, and a further few hundred years for our reply to reach them. <span class="explainq13 explain">It’s not important,&nbsp;then, if there’s a delay of a few years, or decades, while the human race debates the&nbsp;question of whether to reply, and perhaps carefully drafts a reply</span>.</p>
