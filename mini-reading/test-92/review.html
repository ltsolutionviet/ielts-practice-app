    <p>A</p>
    <p>Occasionally, in some difficult musical compositions, there are beautiful, but easy parts - parts so simple a <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span class="explainq9 explain">beginner</span> </strong></span>could play them. So it is with mathematics as&nbsp;well. There are some discoveries in advanced mathematics that do not depend on&nbsp;specialized knowledge, not even on algebra, geometry, or trigonometry. Instead&nbsp;they may involve, at most, a little <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span class="explainq10 explain">arithmetic</span></strong></span>, such as ‘the sum of two odd numbers&nbsp;is even’, and common sense. Each of the eight chapters in this book illustrates this&nbsp;phenomenon. <span class="explainq7 explain">Anyone can understand every step in the reasoning.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p>The thinking in each chapter uses at most only elementary arithmetic, and sometimes not even that. Thus all readers will have the chance to participate in a&nbsp;mathematical experience, to appreciate the beauty of mathematics, and to become&nbsp;familiar with its logical, yet <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span class="explainq11 explain">intuitive</span></strong></span>, style of thinking.</p>
    <p><strong>B</strong></p>
    <p>One of my purposes in writing this book is to give readers who haven’t had the opportunity to see and enjoy real mathematics the chance to appreciate the&nbsp;mathematical way of thinking. I want to reveal not only some of the fascinating&nbsp;discoveries, but, more importantly, the reasoning behind them.&nbsp;In that respect, this book<span class="explainq2 explain"> differs from most books </span>on mathematics written for the general public.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span class="explainq5 explain">Some present the lives of colorful mathematicians. Others describe&nbsp;important applications of mathematics. Yet others go into mathematical procedures,&nbsp;</span>but assume that the reader is adept in using algebra.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>C</strong></p>
    <p>I hope this book will help bridge that notorious gap that separates the two cultures: the humanities and the sciences, or should I say the right brain (intuitive) and the&nbsp;left brain (analytical, numerical). As the chapters will illustrate, mathematics is not&nbsp;restricted to the analytical and numerical; intuition plays a significant role. The&nbsp;alleged gap can be narrowed or completely overcome by anyone, in part because&nbsp;each of us is far from using the full capacity of either side of the brain. To illustrate&nbsp;our human potential, I cite <span class="explainq4 explain">a structural engineer who is an artist, an electrical&nbsp;engineer who is an opera singer, an opera singer who published mathematical&nbsp;research, and a mathematician who publishes short stories</span></p>
    <p><strong>D</strong></p>
    <p>Other <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span class="explainq12 explain">scientists</span> </strong></span>have written books to explain their fields to non-scientists, but have necessarily had to <span class="explainq1 explain">omit the mathematics</span>, although it provides the foundation of their&nbsp;theories. <span style="color: #339966;">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p>The reader must remain a tantalized spectator rather than an involved&nbsp;participant, since the appropriate language for describing the details in much of&nbsp;science is mathematics, whether the subject is expanding universe, subatomic&nbsp;particles, or chromosomes. Though the broad.outline of a scientific theory can be&nbsp;sketched intuitively, when a part of the physical universe is finally understood, its description often looks like a page in a mathematics text.</p>
    <p><strong>E</strong></p>
    <p>Still, the non-mathematical reader can go far in understanding mathematical reasoning. This book presents the details that illustrate the mathematical style&nbsp;of thinking, which involves sustained, step-by-step analysis, <span style="color: #ff0000;">experiments</span>, and&nbsp;insights. You will turn these pages much more slowly than when reading a <span class="explainq6 explain">novel&nbsp;or a newspaper</span>. It may help to have a pencil and paper ready to check claims and&nbsp;carry out <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span class="explainq13 explain">experiments</span></span></strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>F</strong></p>
    <p>As I wrote, I kept in mind <span class="explainq8 explain">two types of readers:</span> those who enjoyed mathematics until they were turned off by an unpleasant episode, usually around fifth grade, and&nbsp;mathematics aficionados, who will find much that is new throughout the book.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This book also serves readers who simply want to sharpen their analytical skills. Many careers, such as law and medicine, require extended, precise analysis. Each&nbsp;chapter offers practice in following a sustained and closely argued line of thought.&nbsp;That mathematics can develop this skill is shown by these two testimonials:</p>
    <p><strong>G</strong></p>
    <p>A physician wrote, the discipline of analytical thought processes [in mathematics] prepared me extremely well for medical school. In medicine one is faced with a&nbsp;problem which must be thoroughly analyzed before a solution can be found.<span style="color: #339966;"><strong><span class="explainq3 explain"> The&nbsp;process is similar to doing mathematics</span>.’&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
    <p>A lawyer made the same point, “Although I had no background in law - not even one political science course — I did well at one of the best law schools. I attribute&nbsp;much of my success there to having learned, through the study of mathematics,&nbsp;and, in particular, <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span class="explainq14 explain">theorems</span></span></strong>, how to analyze complicated principles. <span class="explainq3 explain">Lawyers who&nbsp;have studied mathematics can master the legal principles in a way that most others&nbsp;cannot.’</span></p>
    <p>I hope you will share my delight in watching as simple, even naive, questions lead to remarkable solutions and purely theoretical discoveries find unanticipated&nbsp;applications.</p>
