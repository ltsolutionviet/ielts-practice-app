    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Geoff Brash, who died in 2010, was a gregarious Australian businessman and philanthropist who encouraged the young to reach their potential.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Born in Melbourne to Elsa and Alfred Brash, he was educated at Scotch College. His sister, Barbara, became a renowned artist and printmaker. <span class="explainq1 explain">His father, Alfred, ran the Brash retail music business that had been founded in 1862 by his grandfather, the German immigrant Marcus Brasch, specialising in pianos</span>. It carried the slogan ‘A home is not a home without a piano.’</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his young days, Brash enjoyed the good life, playing golf and sailing, and spending some months travelling through Europe, having a leisurely holiday. <span class="explainq2 explain">He worked for a time at Myer department stores before joining the family business in 1949</span>, where he quickly began to put his stamp on things. In one of his first management decisions, he diverged from his father’s sense of frugal aesthetics by re-carpeting the old man’s office while he was away. <span class="explainq3 explain">After initially complaining of his extravagance, his father grew to accept the change and gave his son increasing responsibility in the business.</span></span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span class="explainq4 explain">After World War II (1939-1945), Brash’s had begun to focus on white goods, such as washing machines and refrigerators, as the consumer boom took hold</span>. However, while his father was content with the business he had built, the younger Brash viewed expansion as vital. When Geoff Brash took over as managing director in 1957, the company had two stores, but after floating it on the stock exchange the following year, he expanded rapidly and opened suburban stores, as well as buying into familiar music industry names such as Allans, Palings and Suttons. Eventually, 170 stores traded across the continent under the Brash’s banner.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Geoff Brash learned from his father’s focus on customer service. Alfred Brash had also been a pioneer in introducing a <span class="explainq6 explain">share scheme</span> for his staff, and his son retained and expanded the plan following the float.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Geoff Brash was optimistic and outward looking. As a result, he was a pioneer in both accessing and selling new technology, and developing overseas relationships. He sourced and sold electric guitars, organs, and a range of other modern instruments, as well as state-of-the-art audio and video equipment. <span class="explainq5 explain">He developed a relationship with Taro Kakehashi, the founder of Japan’s <span class="explainq7 explain">Roland group</span></span>, which led to a joint venture that brought electronic musical devices to Australia.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1965, Brash and his wife attended a <span class="explainq8 explain">trade fair</span> in Guangzhou, the first of its kind in China; they were one of the first Western business people allowed into the country following Mao Zedong’s Cultural Revolution. He returned there many times, helping advise the Chinese in establishing a high quality piano factory in Beijing; he became the factory’s agent in Australia. Brash also took leading <span class="explainq9 explain">jazz</span> musicians Don Burrows and James Morrison to China, on a trip that reintroduced jazz to many Chinese musicians.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He stood down as Executive Chairman of Brash’s in 1988, but under the new management debt became a problem, and in 1994 the banks called in administrators. The company was sold to Singaporean interests and continued to trade until <span class="explainq10 explain">1998</span>, when it again went into administration. The Brash name then disappeared from the retail world. Brash was greatly disappointed by the collapse and the eventual disappearance of the company he had run for so long. But it was not long before he invested in a restructured Allan’s music business.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brash was a committed philanthropist who, in the mid-1980s, established the Brash Foundation, which eventually morphed, with other partners, into the Soundhouse Music Alliance. This was a not-for-profit organisation overseeing and promoting multimedia music making and <span class="explainq11 explain">education</span> for teachers and students. The Soundhouse offers teachers and young people the opportunity to get exposure to the latest music <span class="explainq12 explain">technology</span>, and to use this to compose and record their own music, either alone or in collaboration. The organisation has now also established <span class="explainq13 explain">branches</span> in New Zealand, South Africa and Ireland, as well as numerous sites around Australia.</span></p>
