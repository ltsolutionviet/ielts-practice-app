    <p><em><br>June 2004 saw the first passage, known as a ‘transit’, of the planet Venus across the face of the Sun in&nbsp;122 years. Transits have helped shape our view of&nbsp;the whole Universe, as Heather Cooper and Nigel&nbsp;Henbest explain</em></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>A</strong></p>
    <p>On 8 June 2004, more than half the population of the world were treated to a rare astronomical event. For over six hours, the planet Venus steadily inched its way over the surface of the Sun. This ‘transit’ of Venus was the first since 6 December 1882. On that&nbsp;occasion, the American astronomer Professor Simon Newcomb led a party to South&nbsp;Africa to observe the event. They were based at a girls’ school, where - it is alleged - the&nbsp;combined forces of three schoolmistresses outperformed the professionals with the&nbsp;accuracy of their observations.</p>
    <p><strong>B</strong></p>
    <p>For centuries, transits of Venus have drawn explorers and astronomers alike to the four corners of the globe. And you can put it all down to the extraordinary polymath&nbsp;Edmond Halley. In November 1677, Halley observed a transit of the innermost planet,&nbsp;Mercury, from the desolate island of St Helena in the South Pacific. He realised that,&nbsp;from different latitudes, the passage of the planet across the Sun’s disc would appear to&nbsp;differ. <span class="explainq6 explain">By timing the transit from two widely-separated locations, teams of astronomers&nbsp;could calculate the parallax angle - the apparent difference in position of an&nbsp;astronomical body due to a difference in the observer’s position. Calculating this angle&nbsp;would allow astronomers to measure what was then the ultimate goal: the distance of&nbsp;the Earth from the Sun.</span> This distance is known as the astronomical unit’ or AU.</p>
    <p><strong>C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p>Halley was aware that the AU was one of the most fundamental of all astronomical&nbsp;measurements. Johannes Kepler, in the early 17<sup>th</sup> century, had shown that <span class="explainq7 explain">the distances of the planets from the Sun governed their orbital speeds, which were easily&nbsp;measurable</span>. But no-one had found a way to calculate accurate distances to the planets&nbsp;from the Earth. The goal was to measure the AU; then, knowing the orbital speeds of&nbsp;all the other planets round the Sun, the scale of the Solar System would fall into place.&nbsp;However, Halley realised that Mercury was so far away that its parallax angle would be&nbsp;very difficult to determine. As Venus was closer to the Earth, its parallax angle would be&nbsp;larger, and Halley worked out that by using Venus it would be possible to measure the&nbsp;Suns distance to 1 part in 500. But there was a problem: transits of Venus, unlike those of Mercury, are rare, occurring in pairs roughly eight years apart every hundred or so&nbsp;years. Nevertheless, he accurately predicted that Venus would cross the face of the Sun&nbsp;in both 1761 and 1769 - <span class="explainq9 explain">though he didn’t survive to see either</span>.</p>
    <p><strong>D</strong></p>
    <p>Inspired by Halley’s suggestion of a way to pin down the scale of the Solar System,&nbsp;teams of British and French astronomers set out on expeditions to places as diverse as India and Siberia. But things weren’t helped by Britain and France being at war. The&nbsp;person who deserves most sympathy is the French astronomer Guillaume Le Gentil.</p>
    <p>He was thwarted by the fact that the British were besieging his observation site at Pondicherry in India. <span class="explainq2 explain">Fleeing on a French warship crossing the Indian Ocean, Le Gentil&nbsp;saw a wonderful transit - but the ship’s pitching and <span class="explainq8 explain">rolling ruled out any attempt at&nbsp;making accurate observations</span></span>. Undaunted, he remained south of the equator, keeping&nbsp;himself busy by studying the islands of Mauritius and Madagascar before setting off&nbsp;to observe the next transit in the Philippines. Ironically after travelling nearly 50,000&nbsp;kilometres, <span class="explainq10 explain">his view was clouded out at the last moment,</span> a very dispiriting experience.</p>
    <p><strong>E</strong></p>
    <p>While the early transit timings were as precise as instruments would allow, the&nbsp;measurements were dogged by the ‘black drop’ effect. <span class="explainq11 explain">When Venus begins to cross the Sun’s disc, it looks smeared not circular - which makes it difficult to establish timings</span>.&nbsp;This is due to diffraction of light. The second problem is that Venus exhibits a halo of&nbsp;light when it is seen just outside the Sun’s disc. <span class="explainq4 explain">While this showed astronomers that&nbsp;Venus was surrounded by a thick layer of gases refracting sunlight around it, both&nbsp;effects made it impossible to obtain accurate timings.</span></p>
    <p><strong>F</strong></p>
    <p>But astronomers laboured hard to analyse the results of these expeditions to observe Venus transits. <span class="explainq5 explain">Johann Franz Encke, Director of the Berlin Observatory, finally&nbsp;determined a value for the AU based on all these parallax measurements:&nbsp;153,340,000 km. Reasonably accurate for the time, that is quite close to today’s value</span> of 149,597,870 km, determined by radar, which has now superseded transits and all other&nbsp;methods in accuracy. The AU is a cosmic measuring rod, and the basis of how we scale&nbsp;the Universe today.<span class="explainq1 explain"> The parallax principle can be extended to measure the <span class="explainq13 explain">distances to&nbsp;the stars</span>.</span> If we look at a star in January - when Earth is at one point in its orbit - it will&nbsp;seem to be in a different position from where it appears six months later. Knowing the&nbsp;width of Earth’s orbit, the parallax shift lets astronomers calculate the distance.</p>
    <p><strong>G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p>June 2004’s transit of Venus was thus more of an astronomical spectacle than a&nbsp;scientifically important event. <span class="explainq3 explain">But such transits have paved the way for what might prove to be one of the most vital breakthroughs in the cosmos - detecting Earth-sized&nbsp;planets orbiting other stars.</span></p>
