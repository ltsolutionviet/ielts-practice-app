        <h2>A Chronicle of Timekeeping</h2>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Our conception of time depends on the way we measure it</em></p>
    <p><strong>A</strong></p>
    <p>According to archaeological evidence, at least 5,000 years ago, and long before the advent of the Roman Empire,<span class="explainq8 explain"> the Babylonians began to measure time, introducing calendars&nbsp;to co-ordinate communal activities, to plan the shipment of goods and, in particular, to&nbsp;regulate planting and harvesting</span>. They based their calendars on three natural cycles: the&nbsp;solar day, marked by the successive periods of light and darkness as the earth rotates on&nbsp;its axis; the lunar month, following the phases of the moon as it orbits the earth; and&nbsp;the solar year, defined by the changing seasons that accompany our planet's revolution&nbsp;around the sun.</p>
    <p><strong>B</strong></p>
    <p>Before the invention of artificial light, the moon had greater social impact. And, for those living near the equator in particular, its waxing and waning was more conspicuous than&nbsp;the passing of the seasons. Hence, the calendars that were developed at the lower latitudes&nbsp;were influenced more by the lunar cycle than by the solar year. <span class="explainq2 explain">In more northern climes,&nbsp;however, where seasonal agriculture was practised, the solar year became more crucial</span>. As&nbsp;the Roman Empire expanded northward, it organised its activity chart for the most part&nbsp;around the solar year.</p>
    <p><strong>C</strong></p>
    <p><span class="explainq5 explain">Centuries before the Roman Empire, the Egyptians had formulated a municipal calendar having 12 months of 30 days, with five days added to approximate the solar year</span>. Each&nbsp;period of ten days was marked by the appearance of special groups of stars called decans.&nbsp;At the rise of the star Sirius just before sunrise, which occurred around the all-important&nbsp;annual flooding of the Nile, 12 decans could be seen spanning the heavens. The cosmic&nbsp;significance the Egyptians placed in the 12 decans led them to develop a system in which&nbsp;each interval of darkness (and later, each interval of daylight) was divided into a dozen&nbsp;equal parts. These periods became known as temporal hours because their duration varied&nbsp;according to the changing length of days and nights with the passing of the seasons.&nbsp;Summer hours were long, winter ones short; only at the spring and autumn equinoxes&nbsp;were the hours of daylight and darkness equal. Temporal hours, which were first adopted by the Greeks and then the Romans, who disseminated them through Europe, remained&nbsp;in use for more than 2,500 years.</p>
    <p><strong>D</strong></p>
    <p>In order to track temporal hours during the day, inventors created sundials, which indicate time by the length or direction of the sun's shadow. The sundial's counterpart, the water&nbsp;clock, was designed to measure temporal hours at night. One of the first water clocks&nbsp;was a basin with a small hole near the bottom through which the water dripped out. The&nbsp;falling water level denoted the passing hour as it dipped below hour lines inscribed on the&nbsp;inner surface. Although these devices performed satisfactorily around the Mediterranean,<span class="explainq1 explain">&nbsp;they could not always be depended on in the cloudy and often freezing weather of&nbsp;northern Europe</span>.</p>
    <p><strong>E</strong></p>
    <p>The advent of the mechanical clock meant that although it could be adjusted to maintain temporal hours, it was naturally suited to keeping equal ones. With these, however, <span class="explainq4 explain">arose&nbsp;the question of when to begin counting, and so, in the early 14th century, a number of&nbsp;systems evolved</span>. The schemes that divided the day into 24 equal parts varied according&nbsp;to the start of the count: Italian hours began at sunset, Babylonian hours at sunrise,&nbsp;astronomical hours at midday and 'great clock' hours, used for some large public clocks&nbsp;in Germany, at midnight. Eventually these were superseded by 'small clock', or <span class="explainq6 explain">French,&nbsp;hours, which split the day into two 12-hour periods commencing at midnight</span>.</p>
    <p><strong>F</strong></p>
    <p>The earliest recorded weight-driven mechanical clock was built in 1283 in Bedfordshire in England. The revolutionary aspect of this new timekeeper was neither the descending&nbsp;weight that provided its motive force nor the gear wheels (which had been around for at&nbsp;least 1,300 years) that transferred the power; It was the part called the escapement. In the&nbsp;early 1400s came the invention of the coiled spring or fusee which maintained constant&nbsp;force to the gear wheels of the timekeeper despite the changing tension of its mainspring.&nbsp;<span class="explainq3 explain">By the 16th century, a pendulum clock had been devised, but the pendulum swung in a&nbsp;large arc and thus was not very efficient.</span></p>
    <p><strong>G</strong></p>
    <p>To address this, a variation on the original escapement was invented in 1670, in England.&nbsp;It was called the <span class="explainq9 explain">anchor</span> escapement, which was a lever-based device shaped like a ship's anchor. The motion of a pendulum rocks this device so that it catches and then releases&nbsp;each <span class="explainq11 explain">tooth</span> of the <span class="explainq10 explain">escape wheel</span>, in turn allowing it to turn a precise amount. Unlike&nbsp;the original form used in early pendulum clocks, the anchor escapement permitted the&nbsp;pendulum to travel in a very small arc. Moreover,<span class="explainq7 explain"> this invention allowed the use of a long&nbsp;<span class="explainq12 explain">pendulum</span> which could beat once a <span class="explainq13 explain">second</span> and thus led to the development of a new floorstanding case design, which became known as the grandfather clock.</span></p>
    <p><strong>H</strong></p>
    <p>Today, highly accurate timekeeping instruments set the beat for most electronic devices. Nearly all computers contain a quartz-crystal clock to regulate their operation. Moreover,&nbsp;not only do time signals beamed down from Global Positioning System satellites calibrate&nbsp;the functions of precision navigation equipment, they do so as well for mobile phones,&nbsp;instant stock-trading systems and nationwide power-distribution grids. So integral have&nbsp;these time-based technologies become to day-to-day existence that our dependency on&nbsp;them is recognised only when they fail to work.</p>
