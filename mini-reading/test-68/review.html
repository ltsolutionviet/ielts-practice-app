    <p>Collecting ants can be as simple as picking up stray ones and placing them in a glass jar, or as complicated as completing an exhaustive survey of all species present in an&nbsp;area and estimating their relative abundances. The exact method used will depend on&nbsp;the final purpose of the collections. <span class="explainq1 explain">For taxonomy, or classification, long series, from&nbsp;a single nest, which contain all castes (workers, including majors and minors, and, if&nbsp;present, queens and males) are desirable, to allow the determination of variation within&nbsp;species</span>.<span class="explainq3 explain"> For ecological studies, the most important factor is collecting identifiable&nbsp;samples of as many of the different species present as possible</span>. <span class="explainq4 explain">Unfortunately, these&nbsp;methods are not always compatible</span>. The taxonomist sometimes overlooks whole species&nbsp;in favour of those groups currently under study, while the ecologist often collects only&nbsp;a limited number of specimens of each species, thus reducing their value for taxonomic&nbsp;investigations.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>To collect as wide a range of species as possible, several methods must be used. These include hand collecting, using baits to attract the ants, ground litter sampling, and the use&nbsp;of pitfall traps. Hand collecting consists of searching for ants everywhere they are likely&nbsp;to occur. This includes on the ground, under rocks, logs or other objects on the ground,&nbsp;in rotten wood on the ground or on trees, in vegetation, on tree trunks and under bark.&nbsp;<span class="explainq5 explain">When possible, collections should be made from nests or foraging columns and at least&nbsp;20 to 25 individuals collected.</span> This will ensure that all individuals are of the same species,&nbsp;and so increase their value for detailed studies. Since some species are largely nocturnal,&nbsp;collecting should not be confined to daytime. Specimens are collected using an aspirator&nbsp;(often called a pooter), forceps, a fine, moistened paint brush, or fingers, if the ants are&nbsp;known not to sting. <span class="explainq9 explain">Individual insects are placed in plastic or glass tubes</span> (1.5-3-0 ml&nbsp;capacity for small ants, 5-8 ml for larger ants) containing 75% to 95% ethanol. Plastic tubes&nbsp;with secure tops are better than glass because they are lighter, and do not break as easily if&nbsp;mishandled.</p>
    <p>Baits can be used to attract and concentrate foragers. <span class="explainq7 explain">This often increases the number of individuals collected and attracts species that are otherwise elusive.</span> Sugars and meats or oils&nbsp;will attract different species and a range should be utilised. These baits can be placed either&nbsp;on the ground or on the trunks of trees or large shrubs. When placed on the ground, baits&nbsp;should be situated on small paper cards or other flat, light-coloured surfaces, or in test-tubes&nbsp;or vials. This makes it easier to spot ants and to capture them before they can escape into&nbsp;the surrounding <span class="explainq12 explain">leaf litter</span>.</p>
    <p>Many ants are small and forage primarily in the layer of leaves and other debris on the ground. Collecting these species by hand can be difficult. One of the most successful ways&nbsp;to collect them is to gather the leaf litter in which they are foraging and extract the ants&nbsp;from it. This is most commonly done by placing leaf litter on a <span class="explainq13 explain">screen</span> over a large funnel,&nbsp;often under some <span class="explainq11 explain">heat</span>. As the leaf litter dries from above, ants (and other animals) move&nbsp;downward and eventually fall out the bottom and are collected in <span class="explainq14 explain">alcohol</span> placed below&nbsp;the funnel. <span class="explainq6 explain">This method works especially well in rain forests and marshy areas</span>. A method&nbsp;of improving the catch when using a funnel is to sift the leaf litter through a coarse screen&nbsp;before placing it above the funnel. This will concentrate the litter and remove larger leaves&nbsp;and twigs. It will also allow more litter to be sampled when using a limited number of&nbsp;funnels.</p>
    <p>The pitfall trap is another commonly used tool for collecting ants. A pitfall trap can be any small container placed in the ground with the top level with the surrounding surface and&nbsp;filled with a preservative. Ants are collected when they fall into the trap while foraging.</p>
    <p>The diameter of the traps can vary from about 18 mm to 10 cm and the number used can vary from a few to several hundred. The size of the traps used is influenced largely by&nbsp;personal preference (although larger sizes are generally better), while the number will&nbsp;be determined by the study being undertaken. <span class="explainq10 explain">The preservative used is usually ethylene&nbsp;glycol or propylene glycol, as alcohol will evaporate quickly and the traps will dry out.</span></p>
    <p><span class="explainq8 explain">One advantage of pitfall traps is that they can be used to collect over a period of time with minimal maintenance and intervention</span>. One disadvantage is that some species are not&nbsp;collected as they either avoid the traps or do not commonly encounter them while foraging.</p>
