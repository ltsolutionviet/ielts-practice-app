    <p><strong>A -&nbsp;Shifting the blame &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </strong></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obesity is a huge problem in many Western countries and one which now attracts considerable medical interest as researchers take up the challenge to find a 'cure' for the common condition of being seriously overweight. <span class="explainq1 explain">However, rather than take responsibility for their weight, obese people have often sought solace in the excuse that they have a slow <span class="explainq9 explain">metabolism</span>,</span> a genetic hiccup which sentences more than half the Australian population (63% of men and 47% of women) to a life of battling with their weight. The argument goes like this: it doesn't matter how little they eat, they gain weight because their bodies break down food and <span class="explainq10 explain">turn it into energy more slowly</span> than those with a so-called normal metabolic rate.</span></p>
    <p><strong>B -&nbsp;Expert explains energy requirements of obese people</strong></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">'This is nonsense,' says Dr Susan Jebb from the Dunn Nutrition Unit at Cambridge in England. Despite the persistence of this metabolism myth, science has known for several years that the exact opposite is in fact true. Fat people have faster metabolisms than thin people. 'What is very clear,' says Dr Jebb, 'is that <span class="explainq2 explain">overweight people actually burn off more energy</span>. They have more cells, bigger hearts, bigger lungs and they all need more energy just to keep going.'</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>C -&nbsp;Proof of the truth</strong></span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It took only one night, spent in a sealed room at the Dunn Unit to disabuse one of their patients of the beliefs of a lifetime: her metabolism was fast, not slow. By sealing the room and measuring the exact amount of oxygen she used, <span class="explainq3 explain">researchers were able to show her that her metabolism was not the culprit</span>. It wasn't the answer she expected and probably not the one she wanted but she took the news philosophically.</span></p>
    <p><strong>D -&nbsp;New perspective on the horizon</strong></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the metabolism myth has been completely disproved, science has far from discounted our genes as responsible for making us whatever weight we are, fat or thin. One of the world's leading obesity researchers, geneticist Professor Stephen O'Rahilly, goes so far as to say <span class="explainq4 explain">we are on the threshold of a complete change in the way we view not only morbid obesity, but also everyday overweight</span>. Prof. O'Rahilly's groundbreaking work in Cambridge has proven that <span class="explainq11 explain">obesity can be caused by our genes</span>. 'These people are not weak- willed, slothful or lazy,' says Prof. O'Rahilly, 'They have a medical condition due to a genetic defect and that causes them to be obese.'</span>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>E -&nbsp;Lifestyle change required despite new findings&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Australia, the University of Sydney's Professor Ian Caterson says while major genetic defects may be rare, many people probably have minor <span class="explainq12 explain">genetic variations that combine to dictate weight and are responsible for things such as how much we eat, the amount of exercise we do and the amount of energy we need</span>. When you add up all these little variations, the result is that some people are genetically predisposed to putting on weight. He says while the fast/slow metabolism debate may have been settled, that doesn't mean some other subtle change in the metabolism gene won't be found in overweight people. He is confident that <span class="explainq5 explain">science will, eventually, be able to 'cure' some forms of obesity but the only effective way for the vast majority of overweight and obese people to lose weight is a change of diet and an increase in exercise</span>.</span></p>
    <p><strong>F -&nbsp;Hidden dangers</strong></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the $500 million a year Australians spend trying to lose weight and the $830 million it costs the community in health care, obesity is at epidemic proportions here, as it is in all Western nations. Until recently, research and treatment for obesity had concentrated on <span class="explainq13 explain">behaviour</span> modification, drugs to decrease appetite and surgery. <span class="explainq6 explain">How the drugs worked was often not understood and many caused severe side effects and even death in some patients. Surgery for obesity has also claimed many lives.</span></span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>G -&nbsp;Rodent research leads the way</strong></span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has long been known that a part of the brain called the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hypothalamus is responsible for regulating hunger, among other things. But it wasn't until 1994 that Professor Jeffery Friedman from Rockerfeller University in the US sent science in <span class="explainq7 explain">a new direction by studying an obese mouse</span>. Prof. Friedman found that unlike its thin brothers, the fat mouse did not produce a hitherto unknown hormone called leptin. Manufactured by the fat cells, leptin acts as a messenger, sending signals to the hypothalamus to turn off the appetite. Previously, the fat cells were thought to be responsible simply for storing fat. Prof. Friedman gave the fat mouse leptin and it lost 30% of its body weight in two weeks.</span></p>
    <p><strong>H -&nbsp;A very uncommon complaint</strong></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other side of the Atlantic, Prof. O'Rahilly read about this research with great excitement. For many months two blood samples had lain in the bottom of his freezer, taken from two extremely obese young cousins. He hired a doctor to develop a test for leptin in human blood, which eventually resulted in the discovery that neither of the children's blood contained the hormone. When one cousin was given leptin, she lost a stone in weight and Prof. O'Rahilly made medical history. Here was the first proof that a genetic defect could cause obesity in humans. But <span class="explainq8 explain">leptin deficiency turned out to be an extremely rare condition</span> and there is a lot more research to be done before the 'magic' cure for obesity is ever found.</span></p>
