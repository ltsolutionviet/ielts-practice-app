    <p><strong>A</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ecotourism&nbsp;is often regarded as a form of nature-based tourism and has become an important alternative source of tourists. In addition to providing the traditional resort-leisure product, it has been argued that&nbsp;ecotourism&nbsp;resort management should have a particular focus on best-practice environmental management, an educational and interpretive component, and direct and indirect contributions to the conservation of the natural and cultural environment (Ayala, 1996).</p>
    <p><strong>B</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Couran&nbsp;Cove Island Resort is a large integrated&nbsp;ecotourism-based resort located south of Brisbane on the Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. As the world’s population becomes increasingly urbanised, the demand for tourist attractions which are environmentally friendly, serene and offer amenities of a unique nature, has grown rapidly.&nbsp;Couran&nbsp;Cove Resort, which is one such tourist attractions, is located on South&nbsp;Stradbroke&nbsp;Island, occupying approximately 150 hectares of the island. South&nbsp;Stradbroke&nbsp;Island is separated from the mainland by the&nbsp;Broadwater, a stretch of sea 3 kilometers wide. More than a century ago, there was only one&nbsp;Stradbroke&nbsp;Island, and there were at least four aboriginal tribes living and hunting on the island. Regrettably, most of the original island dwellers were eventually killed by diseases such as tuberculosis, smallpox and influenza by the end of the 19<sup>th&nbsp;</sup>The second ship wreak on the island in 1894, and the <span class="explainq1 explain">subsequent destruction of the ship (the&nbsp;Cambus&nbsp;Wallace) because it contained dynamite</span>, caused a large crater in the&nbsp;sandhills&nbsp;on&nbsp;Stradbroke&nbsp;Island. Eventually, the ocean broke through the weakened land form and&nbsp;Stradbroke&nbsp;became two islands.&nbsp;Couran&nbsp;Cove Island Resort is built on one of the world’s few naturally-occurring sand lands, which is home to a wide range of plant communities and one of the largest remaining remnants of the rare&nbsp;livistona&nbsp;rainforest&nbsp;left on the Gold Coast. Many mangrove and&nbsp;rainforest&nbsp;areas, and&nbsp;Malaleuca&nbsp;Wetlands on South&nbsp;Stradbroke&nbsp;Island (and in Queensland), have been cleared, drained or filled for residential, industrial, agricultural or urban development in the first half of the 20th century. Farmer and&nbsp;graziers&nbsp;finally abandoned South&nbsp;Stradbroke&nbsp;Island in 1939 because the vegetation and the soil conditions there were not suitable for agricultural activities.</p>
    <p><strong>SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES OF&nbsp;COURAN&nbsp;COVE RESORT</strong></p>
    <p>Being located on an offshore island, the resort is only accessible by means of <span class="explainq6 explain">water transportation</span>. The resort provides hourly ferry service from the marina on the mainland to and from the island. Within the resort, transport modes include walking trails, <span class="explainq7 explain">bicycle</span> tracks and the beach train. The reception area is the counter of the shop which has not changed in 8 years at least. The accommodation is an octagonal “Bure”. These are large rooms that are clean but! The equipment is tired and in some cases just working. Our <span class="explainq8 explain">ceiling fan</span> only worked on high speed for example. Beds are hard but clean, there is television, radio, <span class="explainq9 explain">an old air conditioner</span> and a small fridge. These “Bures” are right on top of each other and night noises do carry so be careful what you say and do. The only thing is the <span class="explainq10 explain">mosquitos</span> but if you forget to bring mosquito repellant they sell some on the island.</p>
    <p>As an&nbsp;ecotourism-based resort, most of the planning and development of the attraction has been concentrated on the need to co-exist with the fragile natural environment of South&nbsp;Stradbroke&nbsp;Island to achieve sustainable development.</p>
    <p><strong>WATER AND ENERGY MANAGEMENT</strong></p>
    <p><strong>C &nbsp;</strong>South&nbsp;Stradbroke&nbsp;Island has groundwater at the centre of the island, which has a maximum height of 3 metres above sea level. The water supply is recharged by rainfall and is commonly known as an unconfined freshwater aquifer.&nbsp;Couran&nbsp;Cove Island Resort <span class="explainq3 explain">obtains its water supply by tapping into this aquifer and extracting it via a bore system</span>. Some of the problems which have threatened the island’s freshwater supply include pollution, contamination and over-consumption.<span class="explainq2 explain"> In order to minimise some of these problems, all laundry activities are carried out on the mainland</span>. The resort considers washing machines as onerous to the island’s freshwater supply, and that the detergents contain a high level of phosphates which are a major source of water pollution. The resort uses LPG-power generation rather than a diesel-powered plant for its energy supply, supplemented by wind turbine, which has reduced greenhouse emissions by 70% of diesel-equivalent generation methods. Excess heat recovered from the generator is used to heat the swimming pool. <span class="explainq4 explain">Hot water in the -cabins and for some of the resort’s vehicles are solar-powered</span>. Water efficient fittings are also installed in showers and toilets. However, not all the appliances used by the resort are energy efficient, such as refrigerators. Visitors who stay at the resort are encouraged to monitor their water and energy usage via the in-house television system, and are rewarded with prizes (such as a free return trip to the resort) accordingly if their usage level is low.</p>
    <p><strong>CONCLUDING REMARKS</strong></p>
    <p><strong>D &nbsp;</strong>We examined a case study of good management practice and a pro-active sustainable tourism stance of an eco-resort. In three years of operation,&nbsp;Couran&nbsp;Cove Island Resort has won 23 international and national awards, including the 2001 Australian Tourism Award in the 4-Star Accommodation category. The resort has embraced and <span class="explainq11 explain">has effectively implemented contemporary environmental management practices</span>. It has been argued <span class="explainq5 explain">that the successful implementation of the principles of sustainability should promote long-term social, economic and environmental benefits</span>, while ensuring and enhancing the prospects of continued viability for the tourism enterprise.&nbsp;Couran&nbsp;Cove Island Resort does not conform to the characteristics of the ResortDevelopmentSpectrum, as proposed by Prideaux (2000). According to Prideaux,<span class="explainq12 explain"> the resort should be at least at Phase 3 of the model</span> (the National tourism phase), which describes an integrated resort providing 3-4 star hotel-type accommodation. The primary tourist market in Phase 3 of the model consists mainly of interstate visitors. However, the number of interstate and international tourists visiting the resort is small, with the principal visitor markets comprising locals and residents from nearby towns and the Gold Coast region. The carrying capacity of&nbsp;Couran&nbsp;Cove does not seem to be of any concern to the Resort management. Given that it is a private commercial ecotourist enterprise, regulating the number of visitors to the resort to minimize damage done to the natural environment on South&nbsp;Stradbroke&nbsp;Island is not a binding constraint. However, the Resort’s growth will <span class="explainq13 explain">eventually be constrained by its carrying capacity, and quantity control should be incorporated in the management strategy of the resort</span>.</p>
