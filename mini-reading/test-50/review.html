    <p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>How a sixteenth-century warship was recovered from the seabed</strong></em></p>
    <p>On <span class="explainq2 explain"><strong>19 July 1545</strong></span>, English and French fleets were engaged in a sea battle off&nbsp;the coast of southern England in the&nbsp;area of water called the Solent, between&nbsp;Portsmouth and the Isle of Wight.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Among&nbsp;the English vessels was a warship by the&nbsp;name of Mary Rose. Built in Portsmouth&nbsp;some 35 years earlier, she had had a long&nbsp;and successful fighting career, and was&nbsp;a favourite of King Henry VIII. <span class="explainq1 explain">Accounts&nbsp;of what happened to the ship vary: while&nbsp;witnesses agree that she was not hit&nbsp;by the French, some maintain that she&nbsp;was outdated, overladen and sailing too&nbsp;low in the water, others that she was&nbsp;mishandled by undisciplined crew</span>.</p>
    <p>What&nbsp;is undisputed, however, is that the Mary&nbsp;Rose sank into the Solent that day, taking&nbsp;at least 500 men with her. After the battle,&nbsp;attempts were made to recover the ship,&nbsp;but these failed.</p>
    <p>The Mary Rose came to rest on the seabed, lying on her starboard (right) side&nbsp;at an angle of approximately 60 degrees.&nbsp;The hull (the body of the ship) acted as&nbsp;a trap for the sand and mud carried by&nbsp;Solent currents. As a result, the starboard&nbsp;side filled rapidly, leaving the exposed&nbsp;port (left) side to be eroded by marine&nbsp;organisms and mechanical degradation.&nbsp;Because of the way the ship sank, <span class="explainq3 explain">nearly all of the starboard half survived intact.</span></p>
    <p>During the seventeenth and eighteenth&nbsp;centuries, the entire site became covered&nbsp;with a layer of hard grey clay, which&nbsp;minimised further erosion.</p>
    <p>Then, on 16 June <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span class="explainq8 explain">1836</span></strong></span>, some fishermen in the Solent found that their equipment&nbsp;was caught on an underwater obstruction,&nbsp;which turned out to be the Mary Rose.&nbsp;Diver John Deane happened to be&nbsp;exploring another sunken ship nearby,&nbsp;and the fishermen approached him,&nbsp;asking him to free their gear. Deane dived&nbsp;down, and found the equipment caught&nbsp;on a timber protruding slightly from the&nbsp;seabed. Exploring further, he uncovered&nbsp;several other timbers and a bronze&nbsp;gun. Deane continued diving on the&nbsp;site intermittently until <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span class="explainq6 explain">1840</span></strong></span>, recovering&nbsp;several more guns, two bows, various&nbsp;timbers, part of a pump and various other&nbsp;small finds.</p>
    <p>The Mary Rose then faded into obscurity for another hundred years. But in <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span class="explainq5 explain">1965</span></strong></span>,&nbsp;military historian and amateur diver&nbsp;Alexander McKee, in conjunction with the&nbsp;British Sub-Aqua Club, initiated a project&nbsp;called ‘Solent Ships’. While on paper&nbsp;this was a plan to examine a number of&nbsp;known wrecks in the Solent, what McKee&nbsp;really hoped for was to find the Mary Rose. Ordinary search techniques proved&nbsp;unsatisfactory, so McKee entered into&nbsp;collaboration with Harold E. Edgerton,&nbsp;professor of electrical engineering at the&nbsp;Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>
    <p>In 1967, Edgerton’s side-scan sonar systems revealed a large, unusually&nbsp;shaped object, which McKee believed&nbsp;was the Mary Rose. Further excavations revealed stray pieces of timber and an iron gun. But&nbsp;the climax to the operation came when,&nbsp;on 5 May 1971, part of the ship’s frame&nbsp;was uncovered. <span class="explainq4 explain">McKee and his team&nbsp;now knew for certain that they had found&nbsp;the <strong>wreck</strong>, but were as yet <strong>unaware</strong>&nbsp;that it also housed a treasure trove of&nbsp;beautifully preserved artefacts</span>.<span style="color: #339966;"><em>&nbsp;</em></span></p>
    <p>Interest in the project grew, and in 1979, The&nbsp;Mary Rose Trust was formed, with Prince&nbsp;Charles as its President and Dr Margaret&nbsp;Rule its Archaeological Director. The&nbsp;decision whether or not to salvage the&nbsp;wreck was not an easy one, although&nbsp;an excavation in 1978 had shown that it&nbsp;might be possible to raise the hull. While&nbsp;the original aim was to raise the hull if at&nbsp;all feasible, the operation was not given&nbsp;the go-ahead until January <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span class="explainq7 explain">1982</span></strong></span>, when all&nbsp;the necessary information was available.</p>
    <p>An important factor in trying to salvage the Mary Rose was that the remaining&nbsp;hull was an open shell. This led to an important decision being taken: namely to&nbsp;carry out the lifting operation in three very&nbsp;distinct stages. The hull was attached to&nbsp;a <span style="color: #3366ff;"><span class="explainq9 explain"><strong>lifting frame</strong></span></span>&nbsp;via a network of bolts and&nbsp;lifting wires. The problem of the hull being&nbsp;sucked back downwards into the mud was&nbsp;overcome by using 12 <span class="explainq10 explain">hydraulic jacks</span>.&nbsp;These raised it a few centimetres over a&nbsp;period of several days, as the lifting frame&nbsp;rose slowly up its four legs. It was only&nbsp;when the hull was hanging freely from&nbsp;the lifting frame, clear of the seabed and&nbsp;the suction effect of the surrounding mud,&nbsp;that the salvage operation progressed to&nbsp;the second stage. In this stage, the lifting&nbsp;frame was fixed to a hook attached to a&nbsp;crane, and the hull was lifted completely&nbsp;clear of the seabed and transferred&nbsp;underwater into the lifting cradle. This&nbsp;required precise positioning to locate the&nbsp;legs into the <span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong><span class="explainq11 explain">stabbing guides</span></strong></span>&nbsp;of the <span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong><span class="explainq12 explain">lifting&nbsp;cradle</span>.</strong></span> The lifting cradle was designed&nbsp;to fit the hull justing archaeological survey&nbsp;drawings, and was fitted with <strong><span style="color: #3366ff;"><span class="explainq13 explain">air bags</span></span></strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;provide additional cushioning for the hull’s&nbsp;delicate timber framework. The third and&nbsp;final stage was to lift the entire structure&nbsp;into the air, by which time the hull was&nbsp;also supported from below. Finally, on 11&nbsp;October 1982, millions of people around&nbsp;the world held their breath as the timber&nbsp;skeleton of the Mary Rose was lifted clear&nbsp;of the water, ready to be returned home to&nbsp;Portsmouth.</p>
