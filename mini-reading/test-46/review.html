        <h2>Ant Intelligence</h2>

    <p>When we think of intelligent members of the animal&nbsp;kingdom, the creatures that&nbsp;spring immediately to mind&nbsp;are apes and monkeys. But&nbsp;in fact the social lives of&nbsp;some members of the insect&nbsp;kingdom are sufficiently&nbsp;complex to suggest more&nbsp;than a hint of intelligence.</p>
    <p>Among these, the world of the ant has come in for considerable scrutiny lately, and the&nbsp;idea that ants demonstrate sparks of&nbsp;cognition has certainly not been rejected by&nbsp;those involved in these investigations.</p>
    <p>Ants store food, repel attackers and use chemical signals to contact one another in&nbsp;case of attack. <span class="explainq1 explain">Such chemical&nbsp;communication can be compared to the&nbsp;human use of visual and auditory channels</span>&nbsp;(as in religious chants, advertising images&nbsp;and jingles, political slogans and martial&nbsp;music) to arouse and propagate moods and&nbsp;attitudes. The biologist Lewis Thomas wrote,&nbsp;Ants are so much like human beings as to&nbsp;be an embarrassment. They farm fungi, raise&nbsp;aphids* as livestock, launch armies to war,&nbsp;use chemical sprays to alarm and confuse&nbsp;enemies, capture slaves, engage in child&nbsp;labour, exchange information ceaselessly.&nbsp;They do everything but watch television.'</p>
    <p>However, in ants there is no cultural transmission -everything must be encoded&nbsp;in the genes - whereas in&nbsp;humans the opposite is&nbsp;true. Only basic instincts are&nbsp;carried in the genes of a&nbsp;newborn baby, other skills&nbsp;being learned from others in&nbsp;the community as the child&nbsp;grows up. It may seem that this cultural&nbsp;continuity gives us a huge advantage over&nbsp;ants. They have never mastered fire nor&nbsp;progressed. Their fungus farming and aphid&nbsp;herding crafts are sophisticated when&nbsp;compared to the agricultural skills of&nbsp;humans five thousand years ago but have&nbsp;been totally overtaken by modem human&nbsp;agribusiness.</p>
    <p><span class="explainq11 explain">Or have they? The farming methods of ants are at least sustainable</span>. <span class="explainq12 explain"><span class="explainq13 explain">They do not ruin&nbsp;environments or use enormous amounts of&nbsp;energy</span></span>. Moreover, recent evidence suggests&nbsp;that the crop farming of ants may be more&nbsp;sophisticated and adaptable than was&nbsp;thought.</p>
    <p>Ants were farmers fifty million years before humans were. <span class="explainq7 explain">Ants can't digest the cellulose&nbsp;in leaves - but some fungi can. The ants&nbsp;therefore cultivate these fungi in their nests</span>,&nbsp;bringing them leaves to feed on, and then use them as a source of food. <span class="explainq8 explain"><span class="explainq9 explain">Farmer ants secrete antibiotics to control other fungi that&nbsp;might act as 'weeds’, and spread waste to&nbsp;fertilise the crop</span></span>.</p>
    <p>It was once thought that the fungus that ants cultivate was a single type that they&nbsp;had propagated, essentially unchanged from&nbsp;the distant past. Not so. Ulrich Mueller of&nbsp;Maryland and his colleagues genetically&nbsp;screened 862 different types of fungi taken&nbsp;from ants' nests. These turned out to be&nbsp;highly diverse: it seems that ants are&nbsp;continually domesticating new species. Even&nbsp;more impressively, DNA analysis of the fungi&nbsp;suggests that <span class="explainq10 explain">the ants improve or modify the&nbsp;fungi by regularly swapping and sharing&nbsp;strains with neighbouring ant colonies</span>.</p>
    <p><span class="explainq2 explain">Whereas prehistoric man had no exposure to urban lifestyles - the forcing house of&nbsp;intelligence</span> - the evidence suggests that&nbsp;ants have lived in urban settings for close on&nbsp;a hundred million years, developing and&nbsp;maintaining underground cities of&nbsp;specialised chambers and tunnels.</p>
    <p>When we survey Mexico City, Tokyo, Los Angeles, we are amazed at what has been&nbsp;accomplished by humans. Yet Hoelldobler&nbsp;and Wilson’s magnificent work for ant lovers,&nbsp;The Ants, describes a supercolony of the ant&nbsp;Formica yessensis on the Ishikari Coast of&nbsp;Hokkaido. This ‘megalopolis’ was reported to&nbsp;be composed of 360 million workers and a&nbsp;million queens living in 4,500&nbsp;interconnected nests across a territory of&nbsp;2.7 square kilometres.</p>
    <p>Such enduring and intricately meshed levels of technical achievement outstrip by far&nbsp;anything achieved by our distant ancestors.&nbsp;We hail as masterpieces the cave paintings&nbsp;in southern France and elsewhere, dating&nbsp;back some 20,000 years. Ant societies</p>
    <p>existed in something like their present form more than seventy million years ago. Beside&nbsp;this, prehistoric man looks technologically&nbsp;primitive. Is this then some kind of&nbsp;intelligence, albeit of a different kind?</p>
    <p>Research conducted at Oxford, Sussex and Zurich Universities has shown that when&nbsp;<span class="explainq4 explain">desert ants return from a foraging trip, they&nbsp;navigate by integrating bearings and&nbsp;distances</span>, which they continuously update in&nbsp;their heads. They combine the evidence of&nbsp;visual landmarks with a mental library of&nbsp;local directions, all within a framework which&nbsp;is consulted and updated. So ants can learn&nbsp;too.</p>
    <p>And in a twelve-year programme of work, Ryabko and Reznikova have found evidence&nbsp;that ants can transmit very complex&nbsp;messages. Scouts who had located food in a&nbsp;maze returned to mobilise their foraging&nbsp;teams. They engaged in contact sessions, at&nbsp;the end of which the scout was removed in&nbsp;order to observe what her team might do.&nbsp;<span class="explainq5 explain">Often the foragers proceeded to the exact&nbsp;spot in the maze where the food had been.&nbsp;Elaborate precautions were taken to prevent&nbsp;the foraging team using odour clues</span>.&nbsp;Discussion now centres on whether the route&nbsp;through the maze is communicated as a 'left-right' sequence of turns or as a ‘compass&nbsp;bearing and distance’ message.</p>
    <p>During the course of this exhaustive study, Reznikova has grown so attached to her&nbsp;laboratory ants that she feels she knows&nbsp;them as individuals - even without the paint&nbsp;spots used to mark them. It’s no surprise&nbsp;that Edward Wilson, in his essay, ‘In the&nbsp;company of ants’, advises readers who ask&nbsp;what to do with the ants in their kitchen to:&nbsp;‘Watch where you step. Be careful of little&nbsp;lives.'</p>
