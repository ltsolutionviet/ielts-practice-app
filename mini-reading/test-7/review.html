    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>A</strong> The evolutionary processes that have made modern humans so different from other animals are hard to determine without an ability to examine human species that have not achieved similar things. However, <span class="explainq9 explain">in a scientific masterpiece, Svante Paabo and his colleagues from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, in Leipzig, have made such a comparison possible</span>. In 2009, at a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, they made public an analysis of the <strong>genome</strong>&nbsp;</span><strong>[1]</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Neanderthal man.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>B</strong> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Homo neanderthalensis</strong>,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to give its proper name, <span class="explainq1 explain">lived in Europe and parts of Asia</span> from 400,000 years ago to 30,000 years ago.<span class="explainq14 explain"> Towards the end of this period it shared its range with interlopers</span> in the form of </span><span class="explainq2 explain"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Homo</strong> <strong>sapiens&nbsp;</strong></span><strong>[2]</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span class="explainq15 explain"> who were spreading out from Africa</span>. However, the two species did not settle down to a stable cohabitation. <span class="explainq7 explain">For reasons which are as yet unknown</span>, </span><span class="explainq3 explain">the arrival of Homo sapiens in a region was always quickly followed by the disappearance of Neanderthals.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>C</strong> Before 2009, Dr Paabo and his team had conducted only a superficial comparison between the DNA of Neanderthals and modern humans.&nbsp;</span>Since then, they have performed a more thorough study and, in doing so, have shed a fascinating light on the intertwined history of the two species. That history turns out to be more intertwined than many had previously believed.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>D</strong> Dr Paabo and his colleagues compared their Neanderthal genome (painstakingly reconstructed from three bone samples collected from a cave in Croatia) with that of five living humans from various parts of Africa and Eurasia. <span class="explainq6 explain">Previous genetic analysis, which had only examined DNA passed from mother to child in cellular structures called mitochondria, had suggested no <span class="explainq11 explain">interbreeding</span> between Neanderthals and modern humans. The new, more extensive examination, which looks at DNA in the cell nucleus rather than in the mitochondria, shows this conclusion is wrong</span>. By comparing the DNA in the cell nucleus of Africans (whose ancestors could not have crossbred with Neanderthals, since they did not overlap with them) and various Eurasians (whose ancestors could have crossbred with Neanderthals), Dr Paabo has shown that Eurasians are between one percent and four percent Neanderthal.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>E</strong> That is intriguing. It shows that even after several hundred thousand years of separation, <span class="explainq4 explain">the two species were <span class="explainq24 explain">inter-fertile</span></span><span class="explainq24 explain">.</span> It is strange, though, that <span class="explainq5 explain">no Neanderthal mitochondrial DNA has turned up in modern humans</span>, <span class="explainq10 explain">since the usual pattern of invasion in historical times was for the invaders’ males to mate with the invaded’s females</span>. One piece of self-knowledge, then - at least for non-Africans - is that they have a dash of Neanderthal in them. But Dr Paabo’s work also illuminates the differences between the species. By comparing modem humans, Neanderthals, and chimpanzees, it is possible to distinguish genetic changes which are shared by several species of human in their evolution away from the great-ape lineage, from those which are unique to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homo sapiens.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>F</strong> More than 90 percent of the <strong>‘human accelerated regions’</strong>&nbsp;</span><strong>[3]</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that have been identified in modem people are found in Neanderthals too. However, the rest are not. Dr Paabo has identified 212 parts of the genome that seem to have undergone significant evolution since the species split. The state of genome science is still quite primitive, and it is often unclear what any given bit of DNA is actually doing. But an examination of the 20 largest regions of DNA that have evolved in this way shows that they include several genes which are associated with cognitive ability, and whose malfunction causes serious mental problems. These genes therefore look like good places to start the search for modern humanity’s essence.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>G</strong> The newly evolved regions of DNA also include a gene called RUNX2, which controls bone <span class="explainq12 explain">growth</span>. That may account for differences in the shape of the skull and the rib cage between the two species. By contrast an earlier phase of the study had already shown that <span class="explainq8 explain">Neanderthals and moderns share the same version of a gene called FOXP2, which is involved in the ability to speak</span>, and which differs in chimpanzees. It is all, then, very promising - and a second coup in quick succession for Dr Paabo. Another of his teams has revealed the existence of a hitherto unsuspected species of human, using mitochondrial DNA found in a <span class="explainq13 explain">little-finger bone</span>. If that species, too, could have its full genome read, humanity’s ability to know itself would be enhanced even further.</span></p>
