        <h2>Great Migrations</h2>

    <p>Animal migration, however it is defined, is far more than just the movement of&nbsp;animals. It can loosely be described as travel&nbsp;that takes place at regular intervals - often&nbsp;in an annual cycle - that may involve many&nbsp;members of a species, and is rewarded only&nbsp;after a long journey. It suggests inherited&nbsp;instinct. The biologist Hugh Dingle has&nbsp;identified five characteristics that apply, in&nbsp;varying degrees and combinations, to all&nbsp;migrations. They are prolonged movements&nbsp;that carry animals outside familiar habitats;&nbsp;they tend to be <span class="explainq6 explain">linear, not zigzaggy</span>;they&nbsp;involve special behaviours concerning&nbsp;preparation (such as <span class="explainq7 explain">overfeeding</span>)&nbsp;and&nbsp;arrival; they demand special allocations&nbsp;of energy. And one more: migrating&nbsp;animals maintain an intense attentiveness&nbsp;to the greater mission, which keeps&nbsp;them undistracted by temptations and&nbsp;<span class="explainq8 explain">undeterred by challenges</span> that would turn&nbsp;other animals aside. <span style="color: #3366ff;">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p>An arctic tern, on its 20,000 km flight from the extreme south of South America&nbsp;to the Arctic circle, will take no notice&nbsp;of a nice smelly herring offered from a&nbsp;bird-watcher's boat along the way. While&nbsp;local gulls will dive voraciously for such&nbsp;handouts, the tern flies on.</p>
    <p>Why? The arctic&nbsp;tern resists distraction because it is driven&nbsp;at that moment by an instinctive sense of&nbsp;something we humans find admirable:&nbsp;larger purpose. In other words, it is&nbsp;determined to reach its destination. The&nbsp;bird senses that it can eat, rest and mate&nbsp;later. Right now it is totally <span class="explainq9 explain">focused on&nbsp;the journey</span>; its undivided intent is arrival.</p>
    <p>Reaching some gravelly&nbsp;coastline in the Arctic, upon which other arctic terns have&nbsp;converged, will serve its larger purpose&nbsp;as shaped by evolution: finding a place, a&nbsp;time, and a set of circumstances in which it&nbsp;can successfully hatch and rear offspring.</p>
    <p><span class="explainq2 explain">But migration is a complex issue, and biologists define it differently</span>, depending&nbsp;in part on what sorts of animals they study.&nbsp;Joe! Berger, of the University of Montana,&nbsp;who works on the American pronghorn&nbsp;and other large terrestrial mammals, prefers&nbsp;what he calls a simple, practical definition&nbsp;suited to his beasts: 'movements from&nbsp;a seasonal home area away to another&nbsp;home area and back again'. Generally the&nbsp;reason for such seasonal back-and-forth&nbsp;movement is to seek resources that aren't&nbsp;available within a single area year-round.</p>
    <p>But daily vertical movements by zooplankton in the ocean - upward by&nbsp;night to seek food, downward by day to&nbsp;escape predators - can also be <span class="explainq3 explain">considered&nbsp;migration. So can the movement of aphids&nbsp;</span>when, having depleted the young leaves&nbsp;on one food plant, their offspring then&nbsp;fly onward to a different host plant, with&nbsp;no one aphid ever returning to where it&nbsp;started.</p>
    <p>Dingle is an evolutionary biologist who studies insects. His definition is more&nbsp;intricate than Berger's, citing those five&nbsp;features that distinguish migration from&nbsp;other forms of movement. They allow&nbsp;for the fact that, for example, aphids will&nbsp;become<span class="explainq4 explain"> sensitive to blue light (from the sky) when it's time for takeoff on their&nbsp;big journey, and sensitive to yellow light&nbsp;</span>(reflected from tender young leaves) when&nbsp;it's appropriate to land.</p>
    <p>Birds will fatten&nbsp;themselves with heavy feeding in advance&nbsp;of a long migrational flight. The value of his&nbsp;definition, Dingle argues, is that it focuses&nbsp;attention on what the phenomenon&nbsp;of wildebeest migration shares with&nbsp;the phenomenon of the aphids, and&nbsp;therefore helps guide researchers towards&nbsp;<span class="explainq5 explain">understanding how evolution</span> has produced&nbsp;them all. Human behaviour, however, is having a detrimental impact on animal migration.</p>
    <p>The pronghorn, which resembles an antelope, though they are unrelated,&nbsp;is the fastest land mammal of the New&nbsp;World. One population, which spends the&nbsp;summer in the mountainous Grand Teton&nbsp;National Park of the western USA, follows a&nbsp;narrow route from its summer range in the&nbsp;mountains, across a river, and down onto&nbsp;the <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span class="explainq11 explain">plains</span></span></strong>. Here they wait out the frozen&nbsp;months, feeding mainly on sagebrush&nbsp;blown clear of snow. These pronghorn are&nbsp;notable for the invariance of their<strong> migration&nbsp;route</strong> and the severity of its constriction&nbsp;at three <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span class="explainq12 explain">bottlenecks</span></strong></span>. If they can't pass&nbsp;through each of the three during their&nbsp;spring migration, they can't reach their&nbsp;bounty of summer grazing; if they can't&nbsp;pass through again in autumn, escaping south onto those windblown <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span class="explainq11 explain">plains</span></span></strong>, they&nbsp;are likely to <strong>die</strong> trying to <strong>overwinter</strong> in the&nbsp;deep snow.</p>
    <p>Pronghorn, dependent on&nbsp;<strong>distance vision</strong> and <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span class="explainq10 explain">speed</span></strong></span>&nbsp;to keep safe from&nbsp;predators, traverse high, open shoulders&nbsp;of land, where they can see and run. At&nbsp;one of the bottlenecks, forested hills rise to&nbsp;form a V, leaving a <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span class="explainq13 explain">corridor</span></strong></span>&nbsp;of open ground&nbsp;only about 150 metres wide, filled with&nbsp;<strong>private homes.</strong> Increasing development is&nbsp;leading toward a crisis for the pronghorn,&nbsp;threatening to choke off their <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span class="explainq13 explain">passageway</span></strong></span>.</p>
    <p>Conservation scientists, along with some biologists and land managers within the&nbsp;USA's National Park Service and other&nbsp;agencies, are now working to preserve&nbsp;migrational behaviours, not just species&nbsp;and habitats. A National Forest has&nbsp;recognised the path of the pronghorn,&nbsp;much of which passes across its land, as a&nbsp;protected migration corridor. But neither&nbsp;the Forest Service nor the Park Service&nbsp;can control what happens on private&nbsp;land at a bottleneck. And with certain&nbsp;other migrating species, the challenge is&nbsp;complicated further - by vastly greater&nbsp;distances traversed, more jurisdictions,&nbsp;more borders, more dangers along the way.&nbsp;We will require wisdom and resoluteness to&nbsp;ensure that migrating species can continue&nbsp;their journeying a while longer.</p>
