    <p><span class="explainq1 explain">The Lumière Brothers opened their Cinématographe, at 14 Boulevard des&nbsp;Capucines in Paris</span>, to 100 paying customers&nbsp;over 100 years ago, on December 8, 1895.&nbsp;Before the eyes of the stunned, thrilled&nbsp;audience, photographs came to life and&nbsp;moved across a flat screen.</p>
    <p><strong>B</strong></p>
    <p>So ordinary and routine has this become to us that it takes a determined leap of the&nbsp;imagination to grasp the impact of those first&nbsp;moving images. <span class="explainq6 explain">But it is worth trying, for to&nbsp;understand the initial shock of those images&nbsp;is to understand the extraordinary power&nbsp;and magic of cinema, the unique, hypnotic&nbsp;quality that has made film the most dynamic,&nbsp;effective art form of the 20th century</span>.</p>
    <p><strong>C</strong></p>
    <p>One of the Lumière Brothers' earliest films was a 30-second piece which showed a&nbsp;section of a railway platform flooded with&nbsp;sunshine. A train appears and heads straight&nbsp;for the camera. And that is all that happens.&nbsp;Yet the Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky,&nbsp;one of the greatest of all film artists,&nbsp;described the film as a 'work of genius'. <span class="explainq10 explain">'As&nbsp;the train approached,' wrote Tarkovsky,&nbsp;'panic started in the theatre: people jumped&nbsp;and ran away. That was the moment when&nbsp;cinema was born. The frightened audience&nbsp;could not accept that they were watching a&nbsp;mere picture. Pictures were still, only reality&nbsp;moved; this must, therefore, be reality. In&nbsp;their confusion, they feared that a real train&nbsp;was about to crush them.'</span></p>
    <p><strong>D</strong></p>
    <p>Early cinema audiences often experienced the same confusion. In time, the idea of film became familiar, the magic was accepted -but it never stopped being magic. Film has never lost its unique power to embrace its&nbsp;audiences and transport them to a different&nbsp;world. <span class="explainq11 explain">For Tarkovsky, the key to that magic&nbsp;was the way in which cinema created a&nbsp;dynamic image of the real flow of events</span>. A&nbsp;still picture could only imply the existence of&nbsp;time, while time in a novel passed at the&nbsp;whim of the reader. But in cinema, the real,&nbsp;objective flow of time was captured.</p>
    <p><strong>E</strong></p>
    <p><span class="explainq4 explain">One effect of this realism was to educate the world about itself. For cinema makes the&nbsp;world smaller. Long before people travelled&nbsp;to America or anywhere else, they knew&nbsp;what other places looked like; they knew how&nbsp;other people worked and lived</span>.&nbsp;Overwhelmingly, the lives recorded - at least&nbsp;in film fiction — have been American. From&nbsp;the earliest days of the industry, Hollywood&nbsp;has dominated the world film market.&nbsp;American imagery - the cars, the cities, the&nbsp;cowboys - became the primary imagery of&nbsp;film. Film carried American life and values&nbsp;around the globe.</p>
    <p><strong>F</strong></p>
    <p>And, thanks to film, future generations will know the 20th century more intimately than&nbsp;any other period. We can only imagine what&nbsp;life was like in the 14lh century or in classical&nbsp;Greece. But the life of the modern world has&nbsp;been recorded on film in massive,&nbsp;encyclopaedic detail. We shall be known&nbsp;better than any preceding generations.</p>
    <p><strong>G</strong></p>
    <p>The 'star' was another natural consequence of cinema. The cinema star was effectively born in 1910. Film personalities have such an immediate presence that, inevitably, they&nbsp;become super-real. <span class="explainq5 explain">Because we watch them&nbsp;so closely and because everybody in the&nbsp;world seems to know who they are, they&nbsp;appear more real to us than we do ourselves</span>.&nbsp;The star as magnified human self is one of&nbsp;cinema's most strange and enduring&nbsp;legacies.</p>
    <p><strong>H</strong></p>
    <p>Cinema has also given a new lease of life to the idea of the story. When the Lumière&nbsp;Brothers and other pioneers began showing&nbsp;off this new invention, it was by no means&nbsp;obvious how it would be used. <span class="explainq9 explain">All that&nbsp;mattered at first was the wonder of&nbsp;movement</span>. <span class="explainq12 explain">Indeed, some said that, once this&nbsp;novelty had worn off, cinema would fade&nbsp;away. It was no more than a passing&nbsp;gimmick, a fairground attraction</span>.</p>
    <p><strong>I</strong></p>
    <p>Cinema might, for example, have become&nbsp;primarily a documentary form. Or it might have developed like television - as a strange, noisy transfer of music, information and&nbsp;narrative. <span class="explainq2 explain">But what happened was that it&nbsp;became, overwhelmingly, a medium for&nbsp;telling stories. Originally these were&nbsp;conceived as short stories - early producers&nbsp;doubted the ability of audiences to&nbsp;concentrate for more than the length of a&nbsp;reel. Then, in 1912, an Italian 2-hour film&nbsp;was hugely successful, and Hollywood settled&nbsp;upon the novel-length narrative that remains&nbsp;the dominant cinematic convention of today</span>.</p>
    <p><strong>J</strong></p>
    <p><span class="explainq3 explain">And it has all happened so quickly. Almost unbelievably, it is a mere 100 years since&nbsp;that train arrived and the audience screamed&nbsp;and fled, convinced by the dangerous reality&nbsp;of what they saw, and, perhaps, suddenly&nbsp;aware that the world could never be the&nbsp;same again - that, maybe, it could be better,&nbsp;brighter, more astonishing, more real than&nbsp;reality</span>.</p>
