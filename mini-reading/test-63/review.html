    <p>To biomedical researchers all over the world, twins offer a precious opportunity&nbsp;to untangle the influence of genes and&nbsp;the environment - of nature and nurture.&nbsp;Because identical twins come from a&nbsp;single fertilized egg that splits into two,&nbsp;they share virtually the same genetic&nbsp;code. <span class="explainq1 explain">Any differences between them -one twin having younger looking skin, for&nbsp;example - must be due to environmental&nbsp;factors such as less time spent in the sun.</span></p>
    <p>Alternatively, by comparing the experiences of identical twins with&nbsp;those of fraternal twins, who come from&nbsp;separate eggs and share on average&nbsp;half their DNA, researchers can <strong>quantify</strong>&nbsp;the extent to which our genes affect our lives. If identical twins are more similar&nbsp;to each other with respect to an <strong>ailment</strong>&nbsp;than <strong>fraternal</strong> twins are, then <strong>vulnerability</strong>&nbsp;to the disease must be rooted at least in&nbsp;part in <strong>heredity</strong>.</p>
    <p>These two lines of research - studying the differences between identical twins&nbsp;to <strong>pinpoint</strong> the influence of environment,&nbsp;and comparing identical twins with&nbsp;fraternal ones to measure the role&nbsp;of <strong>inheritance</strong> - have been crucial to&nbsp;understanding the interplay of nature and&nbsp;<strong>nurture</strong> in determining our personalities,&nbsp;behavior, and <strong>vulnerability</strong> to disease.</p>
    <p><span class="explainq7 explain">The idea of using twins to measure the influence of heredity dates back to 1875,</span>&nbsp;<span class="explainq5 explain">when the English scientist Francis Galton&nbsp;first suggested the approach (and coined&nbsp;the phrase 'nature and nurture')</span>. But&nbsp;twin studies took a surprising twist in&nbsp;the 1980s, <span class="explainq9 explain">with the arrival of studies into&nbsp;identical twins who had been separated&nbsp;at birth and reunited as adults.</span> Over two&nbsp;decades 137 sets of twins eventually&nbsp;visited Thomas Bouchard's lab in what&nbsp;became known as the Minnesota Study of&nbsp;Twins Reared Apart. Numerous tests were&nbsp;carried out on the twins, and they were&nbsp;each asked more than 15,000 questions.</p>
    <p><strong>Bouchard</strong> and his colleagues used this mountain of data to identify how far&nbsp;twins were affected by their genetic&nbsp;makeup. The key to their approach was&nbsp;a statistical concept called heritability.&nbsp;in broad terms, the heritability of a trait&nbsp;measures the extent to which differences&nbsp;among members of a population can be&nbsp;explained by differences in their genetics.&nbsp;And wherever <strong>Bouchard</strong> and other&nbsp;scientists looked, it seemed, they found&nbsp;the invisible hand of genetic influence&nbsp;helping to shape our lives.</p>

    <p>Lately, however, twin studies have helped lead scientists to a radical new conclusion:&nbsp;that nature and nurture are not the only&nbsp;elemental forces at work. According to a recent field called epigenetics, there is a&nbsp;third factor also in play, one that in some&nbsp;cases serves as a bridge between the&nbsp;environment and our genes, and in others&nbsp;operates on its own to shape who we are.</p>
    <p><span class="explainq4 explain">Epigenetic processes are <span class="explainq10 explain">chemical</span> reactions tied to neither nature nor&nbsp;nurture but representing what researchers&nbsp;have called a 'third component'</span>. These&nbsp;reactions influence how our genetic&nbsp;code is expressed: how each gene is&nbsp;strengthened or weakened, even turned&nbsp;on or off, to build our bones, brains and&nbsp;all the other parts of our bodies.</p>
    <p>If you think of our DNA as an immense piano keyboard and our genes as the keys&nbsp;- each key symbolizing a segment of DNA&nbsp;responsible for a particular note, or trait,&nbsp;and all the keys combining to make us&nbsp;who we are - then epigenetic processes&nbsp;determine when and how each key can be&nbsp;struck, changing the tune being played.</p>
    <p>One way the study of epigenetics is&nbsp;revolutionizing our understanding of biology is by revealing a mechanism by&nbsp;which <span class="explainq12 explain">the environment directly impacts on&nbsp;genes</span>. Studies of animals, for example,&nbsp;have shown that when a rat experiences&nbsp;stress during pregnancy, it can cause&nbsp;epigenetic changes in a fetus that lead to&nbsp;<span class="explainq13 explain">behavioral problems</span> as the rodent grows&nbsp;up. Other epigenetic processes appear to&nbsp;occur randomly, while others are normal,&nbsp;such as those that guide embryonic cells&nbsp;as they become <span class="explainq11 explain">heart, brain, or liver cells</span>, for example.</p>
    <p>Geneticist Danielle Reed has worked with many twins over the years and thought&nbsp;deeply about what twin studies have&nbsp;taught us. 'It's very clear when you look&nbsp;at twins that much of what they share&nbsp;is hardwired,' she says. 'Many things&nbsp;about them are absolutely the same and&nbsp;unalterable. But it's also clear, when you&nbsp;get to know them, that other things about&nbsp;them are different. Epigenetics is the&nbsp;origin of a lot of those differences, in my&nbsp;view.'</p>
    <p><span class="explainq8 explain">Reed credits Thomas Bouchard's work for today's surge in twin studies</span>. '<span class="explainq8 explain">He was the&nbsp;trailblazer</span>,' she says. 'We forget that 50&nbsp;years ago things like heart disease were&nbsp;thought to be caused entirely by lifestyle.&nbsp;Schizophrenia was thought to be due&nbsp;to poor mothering. Twin studies have&nbsp;allowed us to be more reflective about&nbsp;what people are actually born with and&nbsp;what's caused by experience.'</p>
    <p><span class="explainq6 explain">Having said that, Reed adds, the latest work in epigenetics promises to take our&nbsp;understanding even further</span>. 'What I like&nbsp;to say is that nature writes some things in&nbsp;pencil and some things in pen,' she says.&nbsp;'Things written in pen you can't change.&nbsp;That's DNA. But things written in pencil&nbsp;you can. That's epigenetics. Now that&nbsp;we're actually able to look at the DNA&nbsp;and see where the pencil writings are, it's&nbsp;sort of a whole new world.'</p>
