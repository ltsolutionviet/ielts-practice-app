    <p>An emerging discipline called neuroaesthetics is seeking to bring scientific objectivity to the study of art, and has already given us a better understanding of many masterpieces. The blurred imagery of Impressionist paintings seems to stimulate the brain's amygdala, for instance. Since the amygdala plays a crucial role in our feelings, that finding might explain why&nbsp;many people find these pieces so moving. --&gt;&nbsp;The discipline of neuroaesthetics aims to bring scientific objectivity to the study of art. Neurological studies of the brain, for example, demonstrate the impact which Impressionist paintings have on our <span class="explainq5 explain">emotions</span>.</p>
    <p>Could the same approach also shed light on abstract twentieth-century pieces, from Mondrian's geometrical blocks of colour, to Pollock's seemingly haphazard arrangements&nbsp;of splashed paint on canvas? Sceptics believe that people claim to like such works simply&nbsp;because they are famous. We certainly do have an inclination to follow the crowd. When&nbsp;asked to make simple perceptual decisions such as matching a shape to its rotated image, for&nbsp;example, <span class="explainq1 explain">people often choose a definitively wrong answer if they see others doing the same</span>.&nbsp;It is easy to imagine that this mentality would have even more impact on a fuzzy concept like art appreciation, where there is no right or wrong answer.</p>
    <p>Angelina Hawley-Dolan, of Boston College, Massachusetts, responded to this debate by asking volunteers to view pairs of paintings - either the creations of famous abstract artists or&nbsp;the doodles of infants, chimps and elephants. They then had to judge which they preferred.&nbsp;A third of the paintings were given no captions, while many were labelled incorrectly -volunteers might think they were viewing a chimp's messy brushstrokes when they were actually seeing an acclaimed masterpiece. In each set of trials, volunteers generally preferred&nbsp;the work of renowned artists, even when they believed it was by an animal or a child. It seems&nbsp;that the viewer can <span class="explainq2 explain">sense the artist's vision </span>in paintings, even if they can't explain why.</p>
    <p>Robert Pepperell, an artist based at Cardiff University, creates ambiguous works that are neither entirely abstract nor clearly representational. In one study, Pepperell and his&nbsp;collaborators asked volunteers to decide how'powerful'they considered an artwork to be,&nbsp;and whether they saw anything familiar in the piece. The longer they took to answer these&nbsp;questions, the more highly they rated the piece under scrutiny, and the greater their neural&nbsp;activity. It would seem that the brain sees these images as puzzles, and the harder it is to&nbsp;decipher the meaning, <span class="explainq3 explain">the more rewarding is the moment of recognition</span>.</p>
    <p>And what about artists such as Mondrian, whose paintings consist exclusively of horizontal and vertical lines encasing blocks of colour? Mondrian's works are deceptively simple, but&nbsp;eye-tracking studies confirm that they are<span class="explainq4 explain"> meticulously composed</span>, and that simpiy rotating a&nbsp;piece radically changes the way we view it.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>With the originals, volunteers'eyes tended to stay&nbsp;longer on certain places in the image, but with the altered versions they would flit across a&nbsp;piece more rapidly. As a result, the volunteers considered the altered versions less pleasurable&nbsp;when they later rated the work.</p>
    <p>In a similar study, Oshin Vartanian of Toronto University asked volunteers to compare original paintings with ones which he had altered by moving objects around within the frame. He&nbsp;found that almost everyone preferred the original, whether it was a Van Gogh still life or&nbsp;an abstract by Miro. Vartanian also found that changing the composition of the paintings&nbsp;reduced activation in those brain areas linked with meaning and interpretation.</p>
    <p>In another experiment, Alex Forsythe of the University of Liverpool analysed the visual intricacy of different pieces of art, and her results suggest that many artists use a key level of&nbsp;detail to please the brain. --&gt;&nbsp;Alex Forsythe of the University of Liverpool believes many artists give their works the precise degree of <span class="explainq6 explain">complexity</span> which most appeals to the viewer’s brain.</p>
    <p>Too little and the work is boring, but too much results in a kind of&nbsp;'perceptual overload', according to Forsythe. What's more, appealing pieces both abstract and&nbsp;representational, show signs of '<span class="explainq8 explain">fractals</span>' - repeated motifs recurring in different scales, fractals&nbsp;are common throughout nature, for example in the shapes of mountain peaks or the branches&nbsp;of trees. --&gt;&nbsp;She also observes that pleasing works of art often contain certain repeated <span class="explainq7 explain">images</span> which occur frequently in the natural world. .&nbsp;</p>
    <p>It is possible that our visual system, which evolved in the great outdoors, finds it&nbsp;easier to process such patterns.</p>
    <p>It is also intriguing that the brain appears to process movement when we see a handwritten letter, as if we are replaying the writer's moment of creation. This has led some to wonder&nbsp;whether Pollock's works feel so dynamic because the brain reconstructs the energetic actions&nbsp;the artist used as he painted. This may be down to our brain's 'mirror neurons', which are&nbsp;known to mimic others' actions. The hypothesis will <span class="explainq9 explain">need to be thoroughly tested</span>, however&nbsp;it&nbsp;might even be the case that we could use neuroaesthetic studies to understand the longevity&nbsp;of some pieces of artwork.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>While the fashions of the time might shape what is currently&nbsp;popular, works that are best adapted to our visual system may be the most likely to linger&nbsp;<span class="explainq10 explain">once the trends of previous generations have been forgotten</span>.</p>
    <p>It's still early days for the field of neuroaesthetics - and these studies are probably only a taste of what is to come. It would, however, be foolish to reduce art appreciation to <span class="explainq11 explain">a set of scientific&nbsp;laws</span>.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We shouldn't underestimate the importance of the style of a particular artist,<span class="explainq12 explain"> their place&nbsp;in history and the artistic environment</span> of their time.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span class="explainq14 explain">Abstract art </span>offers both a challenge and the freedom to play with different interpretations. In some ways, it's not so <span class="explainq12 explain explainq13">different to science</span>,&nbsp;where we are constantly looking for systems and decoding meaning so that we can view and&nbsp;appreciate the world in a new way.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
