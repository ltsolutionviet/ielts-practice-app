    <p><span class="explainq-12 explain explainq-124">Though we might think of film as an essentially visual experience, we really&nbsp;cannot afford to underestimate the&nbsp;importance of film sound</span>. A meaningful&nbsp;sound track is often as complicated as&nbsp;the image on the screen, and is ultimately&nbsp;just as much the responsibility of the&nbsp;director. The entire sound track consists&nbsp;of three essential ingredients: the human&nbsp;voice, sound effects and music. <span class="explainq11 explain">These&nbsp;three tracks must be mixed and balanced&nbsp;so as to produce the necessary emphases&nbsp;which in turn create desired effects</span>.</p>
    <p>Topics which essentially refer to the three previously mentioned tracks are&nbsp;discussed below. They include dialogue,&nbsp;synchronous and asynchronous sound&nbsp;effects, and music.</p>
    <p>Let us start with dialogue. <span class="explainq12 explain">As is the case with stage drama, dialogue serves to&nbsp;tell the story and expresses feelings and&nbsp;motivations of characters as well</span>. Often&nbsp;with film characterization the audience&nbsp;perceives little or no difference between&nbsp;the character and the actor. Thus, for&nbsp;example, the actor Humphrey Bogart is&nbsp;the character Sam Spade; <span class="explainq-125 explain">film personality&nbsp;and life personality seem to merge</span>.&nbsp;Perhaps this is because the very texture of&nbsp;a performer's voice supplies an element&nbsp;of character.</p>
    <p><span class="explainq13 explain">When voice textures fit the performer's physiognomy and gestures, a whole&nbsp;and very realistic persona emerges</span>. The viewer sees not an actor working at his&nbsp;craft, but another human being struggling&nbsp;with life. It is interesting to note that how&nbsp;dialogue is used and the very amount of&nbsp;dialogue used varies widely among films.&nbsp;<span class="explainq-126 explain">For example, in the highly successful&nbsp;science-fiction film 2001, little dialogue&nbsp;was evident, and most of it was banal&nbsp;and of little intrinsic interest</span>. In this&nbsp;way the film-maker was able to portray&nbsp;what Thomas Sobochack and Vivian&nbsp;Sobochack call, in An Introduction to Film,&nbsp;the '<span class="explainq-126 explain"><strong>inadequacy</strong> of human responses&nbsp;when compared with the magnificent&nbsp;technology created by man and the visual&nbsp;beauties of the universe</span>'.</p>
    <p>The comedy Bringing Up Baby, on the other hand, presents practically non-stop&nbsp;dialogue delivered at breakneck speed.&nbsp;This use of dialogue underscores not&nbsp;only the dizzy quality of the character&nbsp;played by Katherine Hepburn, but also&nbsp;<span class="explainq-127 explain">the absurdity of the film itself and thus its&nbsp;humor</span>. The audience is bounced from gag&nbsp;to gag and conversation to conversation;&nbsp;there is no time for audience reflection.&nbsp;The audience is caught up in a whirlwind&nbsp;of activity in simply managing to follow&nbsp;the plot. This film presents pure escapism&nbsp;- largely due to its frenetic dialogue.</p>
    <p>Synchronous sound effects are those sounds which are synchronized or&nbsp;matched with what is viewed. For example, if the film portrays a character&nbsp;playing the piano, the sounds of the&nbsp;piano are projected. Synchronous sounds&nbsp;contribute to the realism of film and also&nbsp;help to create a particular atmosphere.</p>
    <p>For example, the 'click' of a door being opened may simply serve to convince&nbsp;the audience that the image portrayed&nbsp;is real, and the audience may only&nbsp;subconsciously note the expected sound.</p>
    <p>However, if the 'click' of an opening door is part of an ominous action such&nbsp;as a burglary,<span class="explainq-128 explain"> the sound mixer may call&nbsp;attention to the 'click' with an increase in&nbsp;volume; this helps to engage the audience&nbsp;in a moment of suspense</span>.</p>
    <p>Asynchronous sound effects, on the other hand, are not matched with a visible&nbsp;source of the sound on screen. Such&nbsp;sounds are included so as to provide an&nbsp;appropriate emotional nuance, and they&nbsp;may also add to the realism of the film.&nbsp;For example, a film-maker might opt&nbsp;to include the background sound of an&nbsp;ambulance's siren while the foreground&nbsp;sound and image portrays an arguing&nbsp;couple. The asynchronous ambulance&nbsp;siren underscores the psychic injury&nbsp;incurred in the argument; at the same&nbsp;time the noise of the siren adds to the&nbsp;realism of the film by acknowledging the&nbsp;film's city setting.</p>
    <p><span class="explainq-129 explain">We are probably all familiar with background music in films, which has&nbsp;become so ubiquitous as to be noticeable&nbsp;in its absence</span>. We are aware that it is used&nbsp;to add emotion and rhythm. Usually not&nbsp;meant to be noticeable, it often provides&nbsp;a tone or an emotional attitude toward&nbsp;the story and /or the characters depicted.&nbsp;<span class="explainq7 explain">In addition, background music often&nbsp;foreshadows a change in mood</span>. For&nbsp;example, dissonant music may be used in&nbsp;film to indicate an approaching (but not&nbsp;yet visible) menace or disaster.</p>
    <p><span class="explainq9 explain">Background music may aid viewer understanding by linking scenes</span>. For&nbsp;example, a particular musical theme&nbsp;associated with an individual character&nbsp;or situation may be repeated at various&nbsp;points in a film in order to remind the&nbsp;audience of salient motifs or ideas.</p>
    <p>Film sound comprises conventions and innovations. We have come to expect an&nbsp;acceleration of music during car chases&nbsp;and creaky doors in horror films. Yet, it&nbsp;is important to note as well that sound&nbsp;is often brilliantly conceived. <span class="explainq10 explain">The effects&nbsp;of sound are often largely subtle and&nbsp;often are noted by only our subconscious&nbsp;minds.</span> We need to foster an awareness of&nbsp;film sound as well as film space so as to truly appreciate an art form that sprang&nbsp;to life during the twentieth century - the&nbsp;modern film.</p>
    <p>--&gt;&nbsp;<span class="explainq8 explain">Background music has more effect on some people than on others: NOT GIVEN</span></p>
