        <h2>THE KEYLESS SOCIETY</h2>

    <p><strong>A -&nbsp;They can't get in without these</strong></p>
    <p>Students who want to enter the University of Montreal's Athletic Complex need more than just a conventional ID card - their identities must be <span class="explainqe explain">authenticated by an electronic hand scanner</span>. In some California housing estates, a key alone is insufficient to get someone in the door; his or her <span class="explainq13 explain"><strong>voice print</strong></span> must also be verified. And soon, customers at some <span class="explainq14 explain">Japanese banks</span> will have to <strong>present</strong> their <strong>faces for scanning</strong> before they can enter the building and withdraw their money.</p>
    <p><strong>B -&nbsp;The figures say it all</strong></p>
    <p>All of these are applications of biometrics, a little-known but fast-growing technology that involves the use of physical or biological characteristics to identify individuals. In use for more than a decade at some high- security government institutions in the United States and Canada, biometrics are now rapidly popping up in the everyday world. Already, <span class="explainq1 explain">more than 10,000 facilities</span>, from prisons to day-care centres, monitor people's fingerprints or other physical parts to ensure that they are who they claim to be. Some 60 biometric companies around the world pulled in at least $22 million last year and that grand total is expected to<span class="explainq1 explain"> mushroom to at least $50 million by 1999.</span></p>
    <p><strong>C -&nbsp;How does it work?</strong></p>
    <p>Biometric security systems operate by storing a digitised record of some unique human feature. When an authorised user wishes to enter or use the facility,<span class="explainq2 explain"> the system scans the person's corresponding characteristics and attempts to match them against those on record</span>. Systems using fingerprints, hands, voices, irises, retinas and faces are already on the market. Others using typing patterns and even body odours are in various stages of development.</p>
    <p><strong>D -&nbsp;Fighting fraud</strong></p>
    <p>Fingerprint scanners are currently the most widely deployed type of biometric application, thanks to their growing use over the last 20 years by law-enforcement agencies. Sixteen American states now use biometric <strong>fingerprint</strong> verification systems to <strong>check</strong> that people claiming <span class="explainq11 explain">welfare payments</span> are <span class="explainq3 explain">genuine</span>. In June, politicians in Toronto voted to do the same, with a pilot project beginning next year.</p>
    <p><strong>E -&nbsp;This type sells best in the shops</strong></p>
    <p>To date, <span class="explainq4 explain">the most widely used commercial biometric system</span> is the <strong>handkey</strong>, a type of <strong>hand scanner</strong> which reads the unique shape, size and irregularities of people's hands. Originally developed for nuclear powerplants, the handkey received its big break when it was used to control access to the <span class="explainq9 explain">Olympic Village in Atlanta by more than 65,000 athletes, <span class="explainq8 explain">trainers</span> and support staff</span>. Now there are scores of other applications.</p>
    <p><strong>F -&nbsp;Who's planning what</strong></p>
    <p>Around the world, the market is growing rapidly. Malaysia, for&nbsp;example, is preparing to equip all of its <span class="explainq10 explain">airports</span> with biometric <strong>face scanners</strong> to match passengers with luggage. And Japan's largest maker of cash dispensers is developing new machines that incorporate iris scanners. The first commercial biometric, a <strong>hand reader</strong> used by an American firm to <span class="explainq12 explain">monitor employee attendance</span>, was introduced in 1974. But only in the past few years has the technology improved enough for the prices to drop sufficiently to make them commercially viable. '<span class="explainq5 explain">When we started four years ago, I had to explain to everyone what a biometric is</span>,' says one marketing expert. Now, there's much more awareness out there.'</p>
    <p><strong>G -&nbsp;Common objections</strong></p>
    <p>Not surprisingly, <span class="explainq6 explain">biometrics raise thorny questions about privacy and the potential for abuse</span>. Some worry that governments and industry will be tempted to use the technology to monitor individual behaviour. If someone used your fingerprints to match your health-insurance records with a credit-card record showing you regularly bought lots of cigarettes and fatty foods,' says one policy analyst, 'you would see your insurance payments go through the roof.' In Toronto, critics of the welfare fingerprint plan complained that it would stigmatise recipients by forcing them to submit to a procedure widely identified with criminals.</p>
    <p><strong>H -&nbsp;Accepting the inevitable</strong></p>
    <p>Nonetheless, support for biometrics is growing in Toronto as it is in many other communities. In an increasingly crowded and complicated world, biometrics may well be a technology <span class="explainq7 explain">whose time has come</span>.</p>
