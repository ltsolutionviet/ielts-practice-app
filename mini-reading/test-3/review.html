        <h2>The True Cost of Food</h2>

    <p><strong><br>A</strong></p>
    <p>For more than forty years the cost of food has been rising. It has now reached a point where a growing&nbsp;number of people believe that it is far too high, and that&nbsp;bringing it down will be one of the great challenges of&nbsp;the twenty first century. That cost, however, is not in&nbsp;immediate cash. In the West at least, most food is now&nbsp;far cheaper to buy in relative terms than it was in 1960.</p>
    <p>The cost is in the collateral damage of the very methods of food production that have made the food&nbsp;cheaper: in the pollution of water, the enervation of soil,&nbsp;the destruction of wildlife, the harm to animal welfare&nbsp;and the threat to human health caused by modern&nbsp;industrial agriculture.</p>
    <p><strong>B</strong></p>
    <p><span class="explainq2 explain">First mechanisation, then mass use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides, then monocultures, then battery rearing of livestock, and now genetic engineering - the&nbsp;onward march of intensive farming has seemed unstoppable in the last half-century, as&nbsp;the yields of produce have soared</span>. But the damage it has caused has been colossal.&nbsp;<span class="explainq5 explain">In Britain, for example, many of our best-loved farmland birds, such as the skylark, the&nbsp;grey partridge, the lapwing and the corn bunting, have vanished from huge stretches&nbsp;of countryside, as have even more wild flowers and insects</span>. This is a direct result of the&nbsp;way we have produced our food in the last four decades. Thousands of miles of&nbsp;hedgerows, thousands of ponds, have disappeared from the landscape. The faecal filth&nbsp;of salmon farming has driven wild salmon from many of the sea lochs and rivers of&nbsp;Scotland. <span class="explainq4 explain">Natural soil fertility is dropping in many areas because of continuous&nbsp;industrial fertiliser and pesticide use, while the growth of algae is increasing in lakes&nbsp;because of the fertiliser run-off</span>.</p>
    <p><strong>C</strong></p>
    <p><span class="explainq7 explain">Put it all together and it looks like a battlefield, but consumers rarely make the connection at the dinner table</span>. <span class="explainq3 explain">That is mainly because the costs of all this damage are&nbsp;what economists refer to as externalities: they are outside the main transaction</span>, which&nbsp;is for example producing and selling a field of wheat, and are borne directly by neither&nbsp;producers nor consumers. To many, the costs may not even appear to be financial at&nbsp;all, but merely aesthetic - a terrible shame, but nothing to do with money. And anyway&nbsp;they, as consumers of food, certainly aren’t paying for it, are they?</p>
    <p><strong>D</strong></p>
    <p>But the costs to society can actually be quantified and, when added up, can amount to staggering sums. A remarkable exercise in doing this has been carried out by one of&nbsp;the world’s leading thinkers on the future of agriculture, Professor Jules Pretty, Director&nbsp;of the Centre for Environment and Society at the University of Essex. Professor Pretty&nbsp;and his colleagues calculated the externalities of British agriculture for one particular&nbsp;year. They added up the costs of repairing the damage it caused, and came up with a&nbsp;total figure of £2,343m. This is equivalent to £208 for every hectare of arable land and&nbsp;permanent pasture, almost as much again as the total government and EU spend on&nbsp;British farming in that year. And according to Professor Pretty, it was a conservative&nbsp;estimate.</p>
    <p><strong>E</strong></p>
    <p><span class="explainq1 explain">The costs included: £120m for removal of pesticides; £16m for removal of nitrates; £55m for removal of phosphates and soil; £23m for the removal of the bug&nbsp;Cryptosporidium from drinking water by water companies</span>; £125m for damage to wildlife&nbsp;habitats, hedgerows and dry stone walls; £1,113m from emissions of gases likely to&nbsp;contribute to climate change; £106m from soil erosion and organic carbon losses;&nbsp;<span class="explainq8 explain">£169m from food poisoning</span>; and £607m from cattle disease. <span class="explainq9 explain">Professor Pretty draws a&nbsp;simple but memorable conclusion from all this: our food bills are actually threefold</span>. We&nbsp;are paying for our supposedly cheaper food in three separate ways: once over the&nbsp;counter, secondly through our taxes, which provide the enormous subsidies propping&nbsp;up modern intensive farming, and thirdly to clean up the mess that modern farming&nbsp;leaves behind.</p>
    <p><strong>F</strong></p>
    <p>So can the true cost of food be brought down? Breaking away from industrial agriculture as the solution to hunger may be very hard for some countries, <span class="explainq10 explain">but in Britain, where the&nbsp;immediate need to supply food is less urgent, and the costs and the damage of&nbsp;intensive farming have been clearly seen, it may be more feasible</span>. The government&nbsp;needs to create sustainable, competitive and diverse farming and food sectors, which&nbsp;will contribute to a thriving and sustainable rural economy, and advance environmental,&nbsp;economic, health, and animal welfare goals.</p>
    <p><strong>G</strong></p>
    <p>But if industrial agriculture is to be replaced, what is a viable alternative? Professor <span class="explainq11 explain">Pretty feels that organic farming would be too big a jump in thinking and in practices for&nbsp;many farmers</span>. Furthermore, the price premium would put the produce out of reach of&nbsp;many poorer consumers. <span class="explainq12 explain">He is recommending the immediate introduction of a'Greener&nbsp;Food Standard’</span>, which would push the market towards more sustainable environmental&nbsp;practices than the current norm, while not requiring the full commitment to organic&nbsp;production. Such a standard would comprise agreed practices for different kinds of&nbsp;farming, covering agrochemical use, soil health, land management, water and energy&nbsp;use, food safety and animal health. <span class="explainq13 explain">It could go a long way, he says, to shifting&nbsp;consumers as well as farmers towards a more sustainable system of agriculture</span>.</p>
