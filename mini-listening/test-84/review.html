    <p><em>You will hear a woman, who has just moved into the area, talking to a neighbour about problems she is having in her house.</em></p>
    <p>Oh, hi Ruth. How are you?</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m sorry to bother you, Alastair, but I’ve been having some problems.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh. Come on in ... What’s happened?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basically, I had a leak from one of the pipes in the bathroom and water started coming through downstairs and the kitchen ceiling’s badly stained. I’ve got the leak fixed temporarily but I wasn’t happy with the plumber and I wanted to ask your advice.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course ... Well, the first thing I’d say is make sure you choose a local company ... that way if things go wrong you’re close by and it just makes things easier.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let me write this down ... Right. Yes. The plumber who fixed things yesterday was from quite far away but I chose him because his advert said he did emergency repairs.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, fair enough ... you needed something in a hurry. But another piece of advice I’d give is try to avoid calling anybody on <span class="explainq1 explain">weekends</span>. That’ll really bump up the prices. Leave it till Monday, if you can.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, yes ... I think I can do that because the temporary fix should hold. And obviously I’ll need the ceiling plastered and eventually re-decorated.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, sure.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So who would you recommend? Is there a directory?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, there’s quite a good website covering this sort of work. It’s www.<span class="explainq2 explain">plasdeco</span>.com. Is that with a K? a C, P-L-A-S-D-E-C-O dot com.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Got it. Well I’ll try and have a look at that.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, it gives price and quality comparisons.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, that’ll be useful, but I find personal recommendations really helpful as well ... you know, you can find out whether you can rely on the company.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I know a couple of reasonable plumbers and also some plasterers.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Great.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Man: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a company called Peake’s Plumbing ... now they’re a father and son team. They’re&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really friendly and they tell you information you need in a <span class="explainq3 explain">clear</span> way ... you know, so they really understand what the problem is.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woman: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Right, well that’s good to know. Are they reliable?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Man: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, that’s a down side - every single time I’ve used them they arrive <span class="explainq4 explain">late</span>. And friends have&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">said the same thing.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woman: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">But is the work good quality?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Man: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Absolutely ... Another one is John Damerol Plumbing Services - he’s very good.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woman: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">How do you spell the surname?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Man: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">D-A-M-E-R-O-L.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woman: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Right ... got that. And does he &nbsp;do high quality work?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Man: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, it’s fine, you know, but I wouldn’t say that was his main point. Basically he comes out&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span class="explainq5 explain">cheaper</span> ... you know ... than other people.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woman: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">I sense there’s a ‘but’ ... is he unreliable?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Man: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh ... he comes when he says he’s coming BUT he’s not very courteous and he has the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">tendency to be <span class="explainq6 explain">messy</span> ... you know so you have quite a bit of clearing up to do.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woman: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Hmmm ... OK.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Man: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">So it’s up to you ... they’re both good workers and they won’t cheat you.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woman: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Right. And you said you knew some plasterers?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Man: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes a company called Simonson Plasterers did our living room last year ... we chose them&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">because we wanted some fancy work on the ceiling - around the lights.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woman: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">So they can do a variety of <span class="explainq7 explain">designs</span>?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Man: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ve got it. But it comes at a premium because they are more <span class="explainq8 explain">expensive</span> ... you know ...</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woman: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">... than the others ...</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Man: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes ... Or you could go for a one-man firm called H.L. Plastering ... Harry Lester - he’s fine&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">- very reliable, if all you want is a simple job ...</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woman: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Do either of them do <span class="explainq9 explain">painting</span> for you if you want ... ? After the plastering’s dried out of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">course.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Man: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s what I was going to say. But I should explain that Harry’s quite old now and so he&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">avoids doing jobs which involve tall <span class="explainq10 explain">ladders</span> ... you know.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woman: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">But my kitchen isn’t too bad for that ... I’d have to ask him if he’s prepared to do it.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Man: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah sure.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woman: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">So I’ll start by looking at the website.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Man: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">All those companies are on there ... with their phone numbers etc ...</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woman: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks ever so much ...</span></p>
